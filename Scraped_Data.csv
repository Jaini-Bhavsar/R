It also acts as the relay center between the body and the brain. We analysed hypothalamic proteome from mice subjected to chronic social defeat paradigm using iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics to identify changes associated with stress response. We identified greater than 2000 proteins after processing our samples analysed through Q-Exactive (Thermo) and Orbitrap Velos (Thermo) at 5% FDR. Analysis of data procured from the runs showed that the proteins whose levels were affected belonged primarily to mitochondrial and metabolic processes, translation, complement pathway among others. We also found increased levels of fibrinogen, myelin basic protein (MBP) and neurofilaments (NEFL, NEFM, NEFH) in the hypothalamus from socially defeated mice. Interestingly, research indicates that these proteins are upregulated in blood and CSF of subjects exposed to trauma and stress. Since hypothalamus secreted proteins can be found in blood and CSF, their utility as biomarkers in depression holds an impressive probability and should be validated in clinical samples.","c(""HPA axis"", ""Social defeat stress"", ""Hypothalamus"", ""Proteomics"")","Shiladitya Mitra","shiladitya_mitra@psyh.mpg.de","27 May 2024"
"S100 proteins: a new frontier in fibromyalgia research","c(""María Teresa Vega-Ramírez"", ""Enrique Becerril-Villanueva"", ""José Luis Maldonado-García"", ""Lenin Pavón"", ""Gilberto Pérez-Sánchez"")","https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-024-01102-9","Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition that causes widespread pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that significantly affect quality of life. The underlying mechanisms of fibromyalgia involve both the immune system and the central nervous system. It has been proposed that changes in multiple ascending and descending pathways in the central nervous system may contribute to increased pain sensitivity in individuals with this condition. Recent research has identified S100 proteins as a new area of interest in fibromyalgia studies. These proteins are a group of small molecular weight proteins involved in inflammation and various functions inside and outside of cells, and they may play a critical role in the development and progression of FM. Although S100B has been the most studied in FM patients, other studies have reported that S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 may also be useful as potential biomarkers or for a deeper understanding of FM pathophysiology. The potential role of S100 proteins in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia could be mediated by RAGE and TLR4, which signal through JNK, ERK, and p38 to activate AP-1 and NF-κB and induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby producing the inflammation, fatigue, and chronic pain characteristic of fibromyalgia. To gain new perspectives on targeted therapeutic approaches, it is crucial to understand how S100 proteins could impact the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia. This review examines the potential role of S100 proteins in fibromyalgia and their impact on improving our comprehension of the condition, as well as facilitating further research on this interesting topic.","list()","c(""Lenin Pavón"", ""Gilberto Pérez-Sánchez"")","""lkuriaki@inprf.gob.mx"", ""gilberto.perez.sanhez@inprf.gob.mx""","26 May 2024"

We have previously reported that αsyn accumulates not only in neurons but also in OLGs long after the administration of αsyn preformed fibrils (PFFs) in mice. However, detailed spatial and temporal analysis of oligodendroglial αsyn aggregates was technically difficult due to the background neuronal αsyn aggregates. The aim of this study is to create a novel mouse that easily enables sensitive and specific detection of αsyn aggregates in OLGs and the comparable analysis of the cellular tropism of αsyn aggregates in MSA brains. To this end, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human αsyn-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in OLGs under the control of the 2’, 3’-cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase (CNP) promoter (CNP-SNCAGFP Tg mice). Injection of αsyn PFFs in these mice induced distinct GFP-positive aggregates in the processes of OLGs as early as one month post-inoculation (mpi), and their number and size increased in a centripetal manner. Moreover, MSA-brain homogenates (BH) induced significantly more oligodendroglial αsyn aggregates than neuronal αsyn aggregates compared to DLB-BH in CNP-SNCAGFP Tg mice, suggestive of their potential tropism of αsyn seeds for OLGs. In conclusion, CNP-SNCAGFP Tg mice are useful for studying the development and tropism of αsyn aggregates in OLGs and could contribute to the development of therapeutics targeting αsyn aggregates in OLGs.","c(""Multiple system atrophy"", ""MSA"", ""α-sy uclei "", ""Glial cytoplasmic i clusio s"", ""GCI"", ""Mouse model"", ""Cellular tropism"", ""Propagatio "", ""Prio hypothesis"")","c(""Ryosuke Takahashi"", ""Hodaka Yamakado"")","""ryosuket@kuhp.kyoto-u.a.jp"", ""yamakado@kuhp.kyoto-u.a.jp""","24 May 2024"

Itch itself elicits an unpleasant experience, which triggers the urge to scratch, relieving the itchiness. Still, it can also result in dissatisfaction when the scratch is too intense and painful or unsatisfactory due to insufficient scratch effect. Therefore, it is likely that the balance between the unpleasantness/pleasure and satisfaction/unsatisfaction associated with itch sensation and scratching behavior is determined by complex brain mechanisms. The physiological/pathological mechanisms underlying this balance remain largely elusive. To address this issue, we targeted the ""reward center"" of the brain, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), in which itch-responsive neurons have been found in rodents. We examined how neurons in the NAc are activated or suppressed during histamine-induced scratching behaviors in mice. The mice received an intradermal injection of histamine or saline at the neck, and the scratching number was analyzed by recording the movement of the bilateral hind limbs for about 45 min after injection. To experimentally manipulate the scratch efficacy in these histamine models, we compared histamine's behavioral and neuronal effects between mice with intact and clipped nails on the hind paws. As expected, the clipping of the hind limb nail increased the number of scratches after the histamine injection. In the brains of mice exhibiting scratching behaviors, we analyzed the expression of the c-fos gene (Fos) as a readout of an immediate activation of neurons during itch/scratch and dopamine receptors (Drd1 and Drd2) using multiplex single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNAscope) in the NAc and surrounding structures. We performed a model-free analysis of gene expression in geometrically divided NAc subregions without assuming the conventional core–shell divisions. The results indicated that even within the NAc, multiple subregions responded differentially to various itch/scratch conditions. We also found different clusters with neurons showing similar or opposite changes in Fos expression and the correlation between scratch number and Fos expression in different itch/scratch conditions. These regional differences and clusters would provide a basis for the complex role of the NAc and surrounding structures in encoding the outcomes of scratching behavior and itchy sensations.","c(""Hierarchical cluster a alysis"", ""Dopami e receptors"", ""Multiplex fluoresce ce i situ hybridizatio "", ""RNAscope"", ""Histami e"", ""Nail clippi g"", ""c-fos"")","Fusao Kato","fusao@jikei.a.jp","23 May 2024"

However, because of a lack of an efficient method for isolating astrocytes from the spinal cord, little is known about how much spinal cord astrocytes are heterogeneous in adult mice. In this study, we developed a new method for isolating spinal astrocytes from adult mice using a cold-active protease from Bacillus licheniformis with an astrocyte cell surface antigen-2 (ACSA-2) antibody. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, isolated spinal ACSA-2+ cells were divided into two distinct populations, ACSA-2high and ACSA-2low. By analyzing the expression of cell-type marker genes, the ACSA-2high and ACSA-2low populations were identified as astrocytes and ependymal cells, respectively. Furthermore, ACSA-2high cells had mRNAs encoding genes that were abundantly expressed in the gray matter (GM) but not white matter astrocytes. By optimizing enzymatic isolation procedures, the yield of GM astrocytes also increased. Therefore, our newly established method enabled the selective and efficient isolation of GM astrocytes from the spinal cord of adult mice and may be useful for bulk- or single-cell RNA-sequencing under physiological and pathological conditions.","c(""Astrocytes"", ""Spi al cord"", ""ACSA-2 a tibody"", ""Cold-active protease"", ""Gray matter"", ""Fluoresce ce-activated cell sorti g"", ""DRAQ5"")","Makoto Tsuda","tsuda@phar.kyushu-u.a.jp","21 May 2024"

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the proportion of CD11c+ microglia in individual CNS regions are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the proportion of CD11c+ microglia in six CNS regions (forebrain, olfactory bulb, diencephalon/midbrain, cerebellum, pons/medulla, and spinal cord) from the developmental to adult stages by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses using a CD11c reporter transgenic mouse line, Itgax-Venus. We found that the proportion of CD11c+ microglia in total microglia varied between CNS regions during postnatal development. Specifically, the proportion was high in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum at postnatal day P(4) and P7, respectively, and approximately half of the total microglia were CD11c+. The proportion declined sharply in all regions to P14, and the low percentage persisted over P56. In the spinal cord, the proportion of CD11c+ microglia was also high at P4 and declined to P14, but increased again at P21 and thereafter. Interestingly, the distribution pattern of CD11c+ microglia in the spinal cord markedly changed from gray matter at P4 to white matter at P21. Collectively, our findings reveal the differences in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the proportion of CD11c+ microglia among CNS regions from early development to adult stages in normal mice.

The rat CIVP model was established using a mixture of 5% (w/v) 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and 50% ethanol at a volume ratio of 2:1 via enema. Rats in the moxibustion group received herb-partitioned moxibustion at Tianshu (ST25, bilateral) and Qihai (CV6) points. The abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR), mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) were adopted for pain behavior observation and pain sensitivity assessment. The circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression profiles were detected using the high-throughput sequencing technique. Relevant databases and bioinformatics analysis methods were used to screen for differentially expressed (DE) RNAs and build a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA (competing endogenous RNA) ceRNA regulatory network. The real-time quantitative PCR was employed to verify the sequencing result. CIVP rat models had a significantly higher AWR and lower TWL and MWT than normal rats. Between normal and model rats, there were 103 DE-circRNAs, 16 DE-miRNAs, and 397 DE-mRNAs in the spinal cord. Compared with the model group, the moxibustion group had a lower AWR and higher TWL and MWT; between these two groups, there were 118 DE-circRNAs, 15 DE-miRNAs, and 804 DE-mRNAs in the spinal cord. Two ceRNA networks were chosen to be verified. As a result, moxibustion’s analgesic effect on visceral pain in CIVP rats may be associated with regulating the circRNA_02767/rno-miR-483-3p/Gfap network in the spinal cord and improving central sensitization.","c(""Visceral pai "", ""Colitis"", ""Moxibustio "", ""A algesia"", ""Ce tral mecha ism"", ""ceRNA etwork"")","c(""Xuejun Wang"", ""Xiaopeng Ma"")","""wangxuejun9527@126.om"", ""pengpengma@163.om""","15 May 2024"

Hypothalamic microglia play a crucial role in brain inflammation and central-peripheral immune circuits via the production of inflammatory mediators. In the present study, we evaluated possible changes in excessive secretion of gut microbiota-derived endotoxin and the expression timeline of several inflammation-regulatory mediators and their inhibiting modulators in hypothalamic microglia of a mouse model of cancer cachexia following transplantation of pancreatic cancer cells. We demonstrated that the plasma level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was significantly increased with an increase in anaerobic bacteria, especially Firmicutes, in the gut at the late stage of tumor-bearing mice that exhibited dramatic appetite loss, sarcopenia and severe peripheral immune suppression. At the early stage, in which tumor-bearing mice had not yet displayed “cachexia symptoms”, the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not of the neurodegenerative and severe inflammatory modulator lipocalin-2 (LCN2), was significantly increased, whereas at the late “cachexia stage”, the level of LCN2 mRNA was significantly increased along with significant decreases in levels of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and CD112R in hypothalamic microglia. In addition, a high density of activated neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus region and a significant increase in corticosterone secretion were found in cachexia model mice. Related to the cachexia state, released corticosterone was clearly increased in normal mice with specific activation of PVN neurons. A marked decrease in the natural killer cell population was also observed in the spleen of mice with robust activation of PVN neurons as well as mice with cancer cachexia. On the other hand, in vivo administration of LPS in normal mice induced hypothalamic microglia with low expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors. These findings suggest that the induction of cancer cachexia may parallel exacerbation of the hypothalamic inflammatory status with polarization to microglia expressed with low levels of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors following LPS release from the gut microflora.","c(""Cachexia"", ""I hibitory immu e checkpoi t receptors"", ""Microglia"", ""Hypothalamus"", ""LPS"", ""Lipocali -2"", ""Gut microbiota"")","c(""Naoko Kuzumaki"", ""Minoru Narita"")","""n-kuzumaki@hoshi.a.jp"", ""narita@hoshi.a.jp""","29 April 2024"

This delay obviously plays in favor of disease progression to an extent that makes efficient treatments difficult, as they arrive too late. The development of a novel medical strategy, termed cell-based interception and precision medicine, seeks to identify dysfunctional cells early, when tissue damages are not apparent and symptoms not yet present, and develop therapies to treat diseases early. Central to this strategy is the use of single-cell technologies that allow detection of molecular changes in cells at the time of phenotypical bifurcation from health to disease. In this article we describe a general procedure to support such an approach applied to neurodegenerative disorders. This procedure combines four components directed towards highly complementary objectives: 1) a high-performance single-cell proteomics (SCP) method (Detect), 2) the development of disease experimental cell models and predictive computational models of cell trajectories (Understand), 3) the discovery of specific targets and personalized therapies (Cure), and 4) the creation of a community of collaborating laboratories to accelerate the development of this novel medical paradigm (Collaborate).

Using electrophysiology in ex vivo hippocampal slices from SP-deficient mice (SPKO), we show that absence of SP is associated with a deficit of LTD at Sc-CA1 synapses induced by LFS-LTD and STDP. As LTD is known to require AMPA- receptors internalization and IP3-receptors calcium signaling, we tested by western blotting and immunochemistry if there were changes in their expression which we found to be reduced. While we were not able to induce LTD, long-term potentiation (LTP), albeit diminished in SPKO, can be recovered by using a stronger stimulation protocol. In SPKO we found no differences in NMDAR, which are the primary site of calcium signalling to induce LTP.

It is caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of a long CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence within the ATXN3 gene, encoding for an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat sequence within the ataxin-3 protein. Ataxin-3 containing an expanded polyQ repeat is known to be highly prone to intraneuronal aggregation, and previous studies have demonstrated that protein quality control pathways, such as autophagy, are impaired in MJD patients and animal models of the disease. In this study, we tested the therapeutic potential of spermidine on zebrafish and rodent models of MJD to determine its capacity to induce autophagy and improve functional output. Spermidine treatment of transgenic MJD zebrafish induced autophagy and resulted in increased distances swum by the MJD zebrafish. Interestingly, treatment of the CMVMJD135 mouse model of MJD with spermidine added to drinking water did not produce any improvement in motor behaviour assays, neurological testing or neuropathology. In fact, wild type mice treated with spermidine were found to have decreased rotarod performance when compared to control animals. Immunoblot analysis of protein lysates extracted from mouse cerebellar tissue found little differences between the groups, except for an increased level of phospho-ULK1 in spermidine treated animals, suggesting that autophagy was indeed induced. As we detected decreased motor performance in wild type mice following treatment with spermidine, we conducted follow up studies into the effects of spermidine treatment in zebrafish. Interestingly, we found that in addition to inducing autophagy, spermidine treatment also induced apoptosis, particularly in wild type zebrafish.

Defining what constitutes the claustrum is imperative for elucidating its functions. Methods based on gene/protein expression or transgenic mice have been used to spatially outline the claustrum but often report incomplete labeling and/or lack of specificity during certain neurodevelopmental timepoints. To reliably identify claustrum projection cells in mice, we propose a simple immunolabelling method that juxtaposes the expression pattern of claustrum-enriched and cortical-enriched markers. We determined that claustrum cells immunoreactive for the claustrum-enriched markers Nurr1 and Nr2f2 are devoid of the cortical marker Tle4, which allowed us to differentiate the claustrum from adjoining cortical cells. Using retrograde tracing, we verified that nearly all claustrum projection neurons lack Tle4 but expressed Nurr1/Nr2f2 markers to different degrees. At neonatal stages between 7 and 21 days, claustrum projection neurons were identified by their Nurr1-postive/Tle4-negative expression profile, a time-period when other immunolabelling techniques used to localize the claustrum in adult mice are ineffective. Finally, exposure to environmental novelty enhanced the expression of the neuronal activation marker c-Fos in the claustrum region. Notably, c-Fos labeling was mainly restricted to Nurr1-positive cells and nearly absent from Tle4-positive cells, thus corroborating previous work reporting novelty-induced claustrum activation. Taken together, this method will aid in studying the claustrum during postnatal development and may improve histological and functional studies where other approaches are not amenable.","c(""Claustrum"", ""Clautrocortical"", ""A terior ci gulate cortex"", ""Retrosple ial cortex"", ""Nurr1"", ""Nr2f2"", ""Tle4"", ""c-Fos"", ""Ope field"")","Jesse Jackson","jakson4@ualberta.a","17 February 2024"

However, little is known about how Tau’s phosphorylation state affects its dynamics and organisation at the single-molecule level. Here, using quantitative single-molecule localisation microscopy, we examined how mimicking or abrogating phosphorylation at 14 disease-associated serine and threonine residues through mutagenesis influences the behaviour of Tau in live Neuro-2a cells. We observed that both pseudohyperphosphorylated Tau (TauE14) and phosphorylation-deficient Tau (TauA14) exhibit a heterogeneous mobility pattern near the plasma membrane. Notably, we found that the mobility of TauE14 molecules was higher than wild-type Tau molecules, while TauA14 molecules displayed lower mobility. Moreover, TauA14 was organised in a filament-like structure resembling cytoskeletal filaments, within which TauA14 exhibited spatial and kinetic heterogeneity. Our study provides a direct visualisation of how the phosphorylation state of Tau affects its spatial and temporal organisation, presumably reflecting the phosphorylation-dependent changes in the interactions between Tau and its partners.

However, it still remains unknown whether Vb neurons in the EC provide projections to the hippocampus. In this study, using a molecular marker for Vb and retrograde tracers, we identified that the outer layer of Vb neurons in the medial EC (MEC) directly project to both dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), with a significant preference for the ventral DG. In contrast to the distribution of DG-projecting Vb cells, anterior thalamus-projecting Vb cells are distributed through the outer to the inner layer of Vb. Furthermore, dual tracer injections revealed that DG-projecting Vb cells and anterior thalamus-projecting Vb cells are distinct populations.

CKs are peptide, pleiotropic molecules involved in a broad range of cellular functions, with a pivotal role in resolving the inflammation and promoting tissue healing. However, pro-inflammatory CKs can exert a detrimental effect in pathological conditions, spreading the damage. In the inflamed CNS, CKs recruit immune cells, stimulate the local production of other inflammatory mediators, and promote synaptic dysfunction. Our understanding of neuroinflammation in humans owes much to the study of multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common autoimmune and demyelinating disease, in which autoreactive T cells migrate from the periphery to the CNS after the encounter with a still unknown antigen. CNS-infiltrating T cells produce pro-inflammatory CKs that aggravate local demyelination and neurodegeneration.

Recently, it was found that enzyme Ornithine Decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) acts as a bridge between the astrocytic urea cycle and the putrescine-to-GABA conversion pathway in the brain of AD mouse models as well as human patients. In this study, we show that the long-term knockdown of astrocytic Odc1 in APP/PS1 animals was sufficient to completely clear Aβ plaques in the hippocampus while simultaneously switching the astrocytes from a detrimental reactive state to a regenerative active state, characterized by proBDNF expression. Our experiments also reveal an effect of astrocytic ODC1 inhibition on the expression of genes involved in synapse pruning and organization, histone modification, apoptotic signaling and protein processing. These genes are previously known to be associated with astrocytic activation and together create a neuroregeneration-supportive environment in the brain. By inhibiting ODC1 for a long period of 3 months in AD mice, we demonstrate that the beneficial amyloid-clearing process of astrocytes can be completely segregated from the systemically harmful astrocytic response to insult. Our study reports an almost complete clearance of Aβ plaques by controlling an endogenous degradation process, which also modifies the astrocytic state to create a regeneration-supportive environment in the brain.

On the other hand, Island cells in MECII, project to GABAergic neurons in hippocampal CA1, suppress the MECIII input into the CA1 pyramidal cells through the feed-forward inhibition, and inhibit TFC. However, it remains unknown about how Island cells activity is regulated during TFC. In this study, we report that dopamine D1 receptor is preferentially expressed in Island cells in the MEC. Optogenetic activation of dopamine D1 receptors in Island cells facilitate the Island cell activity and inhibited hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell activity during TFC. The optogenetic activation caused the impairment of TFC memory recall without affecting contextual fear memory recall. These results suggest that dopamine D1 receptor in Island cells have a crucial role for the regulation of temporal association learning.","c(""Medial e torhi al cortex"", ""Hippocampus"", ""Trace fear co ditio i g"", ""Optoge etics"", ""Isla d cells"", ""Dopami e D1 receptor"", ""c-Fos"")","Takashi Kitamura","Takashi.Kitamura@UTSouthwestern.edu","14 November 2023"

Pregabalin, used clinically in the treatment of chronic pain and epilepsy, inhibits P/Q-type calcium channel activity and recent studies suggest that it may have potential for the treatment of migraine. Spreading Depolarization (SD) is a neurophysiological phenomenon that can occur during migraine with aura by propagating a wave of silenced neuronal function through cortex and sometimes subcortical brain structures. Here, utilizing an optogenetic stimulation technique optimized to allow for non-invasive initiation of cortical SD, we demonstrate that chronic pregabalin administration [12 mg/kg/day (s.c.)] in vivo increased the threshold for cortical spreading depolarization in transgenic mice harboring the clinically-relevant Cav2.1S218L mutation (S218L). In addition, chronic pregabalin treatment limited subcortical propagation of recurrent spreading depolarization events to the striatum and hippocampus in both wild-type and S218L mice. To examine contributing underlying mechanisms of action of chronic pregabalin, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in CA1 neurons in ex vivo brain slices from mice treated with chronic pregabalin vs vehicle. In WT mice, chronic pregabalin produced a decrease in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) amplitude with no effect on frequency. In contrast, in S218L mice chronic pregabalin produced an increase in sEPSC amplitude and decreased frequency. These electrophysiological findings suggest that in FHM-1 mice chronic pregabalin acts through both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms in CA1 hippocampal neurons to elicit FHM-1 genotype-specific inhibitory action. The results highlight the potential of chronic pregabalin to limit recurrent SD to subcortical brain structures during pathophysiological events in both the genetically-normal and FHM-1 brain. The work further provides insights into FHM-1 pathophysiology and the potential for chronic pregabalin treatment to prevent SD in migraineurs.","c(""Spreadi g depolarizatio "", ""Pregabali "", ""Familial hemiplegic migrai e"", ""Spo ta eous excitatory postsy aptic curre ts"")","Terrance P.

In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to distal branch of middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO). The expression of MLKL, connexin 43 (Cx43) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) in vitro and in vivo were assessed by Western blot. Bioinformatic methods were used to predict the potential binding sites where MLKL interacted with Cx43, and the ubiquitination degradation of Cx43 regulated by VHL. The interactions among MLKL, Cx43, VHL, and Ubiquitin were assessed by immunoprecipitation. Dye uptake assay were used to examine the Cx43 hemichannels. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured using Fluo-4 AM. Overexpression and site-directed mutagenesis studies were used to study the mechanisms by which MLKL regulates Cx43 ubiquitinational degradation to mediate neuronal necroptosis. We found that MLKL and Cx43 were upregulated in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPN) of the ipsilateral thalamus after dMCAO. In the in vitro experiments MLKL and Cx43 were upregulated after TSZ-mediated necroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. The interaction between MLKL and Cx43 inhibited the K48-linked ubiquitination of Cx43 in necroptotic SH-SY5Y cells. VHL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Cx43, and MLKL competes with VHL for binding to Cx43. Interaction of MLKL Ser454 with Cx43 can trigger the opening of Cx43 hemichannels, causing increased intracellular Ca2+, and cell necroptosis. This innovative study at animal models, cellular, and molecular levels is anticipated to clarify the roles of MLKL and Cx43 in thalamic damage after focal cortical infarction.

These functions are intricately regulated by a variety of Ca2+-dependent cellular processes, encompassing synaptic plasticity, neuro/gliotransmitter release, and gene expression. In our previous work, we developed ‘monster OptoSTIM1’ (monSTIM1), an improved OptoSTIM1 that selectively activates Ca2+-release–activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane through blue light, allowing precise control over intracellular Ca2+ signaling and specific brain functions. However, the large size of the coding sequence of monSTIM1 poses a limitation for its widespread use, as it exceeds the packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV). To address this constraint, we have introduced monSTIM1 variants with reduced coding sequence sizes and established AAV-based systems for expressing them in neurons and glial cells in the mouse brain. Upon expression by AAVs, these monSTIM1 variants significantly increased the expression levels of cFos in neurons and astrocytes in the hippocampal CA1 region following non-invasive light illumination. The use of monSTIM1 variants offers a promising avenue for investigating the spatiotemporal roles of Ca2+-mediated cellular activities in various brain functions.

However, whether and how the spreading of α-synuclein aggregates modulates synaptic function before neuronal loss remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of intrastriatal injection of α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) on synaptic activity in the somatosensory cortex using a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, histology, and Golgi-Cox staining. Intrastriatal PFF injection was followed by formation of phosphorylated α-synuclein inclusions in layer 5 of the somatosensory cortex, leading to a decrease in synapse density, dendritic spines, and spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents, without apparent neuronal loss. Additionally, three-dimensional reconstruction of microglia using confocal imaging showed an increase in the engulfment of synapses.

Optogenetic inhibition of pyramidal neuron activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during the application of repetitive noxious pin pricks eliminated this catastrophizing behavior. Time-lapse calcium (Ca2+) imaging in the ACC further revealed an increase in spontaneous neural activity after the delivery of noxious stimuli.

However, the mechanism of Rab11a’s involvement in the regulation of inflammatory pain remains obscure. Here, we aim to elucidate the potential mechanisms through which Rab11a contributes to the development of inflammatory pain in the spinal level. It’s shown that neurons, rather than glial cells, were the primary cell type expressing Rab11a in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH). After intra-plantar injection of CFA, both the number of Fos/Rab11a-immunopositive neurons and the expression of Rab11a were increased. Administration of Rab11a-shRNA into the SDH resulted in significantly analgesic effect in mice with CFA injection. Application of Rab11a-shRNA also reduced the NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC) and the spike number of neurons in lamina II of the SDH in mice with CFA injection, without affecting the presynaptic glutamate release and the postsynaptic AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC. Our results thus suggest that the enhanced expression of neuronal Rab11a may be important for the process of inflammatory pain in mice with CFA injection, which is likely mediated by Rab11a’s potentiation of the competence of post-synaptic NMDAR and spiking of SDH neurons.","c(""Rab11a"", ""Spi al dorsal hor "", ""I flammatory pai "", ""NMDA receptor"")","c(""Xian-Xia Yan"", ""Tao Chen"")","""yanxx07@xjtu.edu.n"", ""htkkl@fmmu.edu.n""","28 September 2023"

It is associated with the expression of activity-dependent genes that may mediate initial or cellular memory consolidation. Several genes have been identified to date, however, to fully understand the mechanisms of memory consolidation, additional candidates must be identified. In this cross-species study, we used a contextual novelty-exploration paradigm to identify changes in gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus of both mice and rats. We found that changes in gene expression following contextual novelty varied between the two species, with 9 genes being upregulated in mice and 3 genes in rats. Comparison across species revealed that ArfGAP with a GTPase domain, an ankyrin repeat and PH domain 3 (Agap3) was the only gene being upregulated in both, suggesting a potentially conserved role for Agap3. AGAP3 is known to regulate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor trafficking in the synapse, which suggests that increased transcription of Agap3 may be involved in maintaining functional plasticity. While we identified several genes affected by contextual novelty exploration, we were unable to fully reverse these changes using SCH 23390, a dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we show that Purkinje cells (PCs), which have established adult-type monosynaptic innervation by climbing fibers (CFs) after elimination of weak CFs during development, can be reinnervated by multiple CFs by increased expression of the synaptic organizer C1ql1 in CFs or Bai3, a receptor for C1ql1, in PCs. In the adult cerebellum, CFs are known to have transverse branches that run in a mediolateral direction without forming synapses with PCs. Electrophysiological, Ca2+-imaging and immunohistochemical studies showed that overexpression of C1ql1 or Bai3 caused these CF transverse branches to elongate and synapse on the distal dendrites of mature PCs. Mature PCs were also reinnervated by multiple CFs when the glutamate receptor GluD2, which is essential for the maintenance of synapses between granule cells and PCs, was deleted. Interestingly, the effect of GluD2 knockout was not observed in Bai3 knockout PCs. In addition, C1ql1 levels were significantly upregulated in CFs of GluD2 knockout mice, suggesting that endogenous, not overexpressed, C1ql1-Bai3 signaling could regulate the reinnervation of mature PCs by CFs. Furthermore, the effects of C1ql1 and Bai3 overexpression required neuronal activity in the PC and CF, respectively. C1ql1 immunoreactivity at CF-PC synapses was reduced when the neuronal activity of CFs was suppressed. These results suggest that C1ql1-Bai3 signaling may mediate CF synaptogenesis in mature PCs, potentially in concert with neuronal activity.","c(""Cerebellum"", ""Purki je cell"", ""Climbi g fiber"", ""Sy apse"", ""Electrophysiology"", ""C1ql1"", ""Bai3"")","Michisuke Yuzaki","myuzaki@keio.jp","24 July 2023"

Recent studies on schizophrenia have highlighted the involvement of inflammatory and immunoregulatory mechanisms with the onset of symptoms, and the usage of anti-inflammatory treatments are being tested against periods of rapid psychosis. In the central nervous system, microglia are the innate immune population which are activated in response to a wide range of physical and psychological stress factors and produce proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines. Microglial activation and neuroinflammation has been associated to numerous psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, especially during psychotic episodes. Thus, novel treatments which dampen microglial activation may be of great relevance in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Fingolimod (FTY720) is a drug used as an immunosuppressive treatment to multiple sclerosis. Recent clinical trials have focused on FTY720 as a treatment for the behavioral symptoms in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms of Fingolimod in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia are not clear. In this study we use a recently developed neuroinflammatory psychosis model in mice: cuprizone short-term exposure, to investigate the effects of FTY720 administration. FTY720 administration was able to completely alleviate methamphetamine hypersensitivity caused by cuprizone exposure.

Microglial cells were originally thought to be the only source of TSPO overexpression but astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells can also up-regulate TSPO depending on the pathological context. This study aims to determine the cellular origin of TSPO overexpression in a simplified model of neuroinflammation and to identify the molecular pathways involved. This is essential to better interpret TSPO molecular imaging in preclinical and clinical settings. We used lentiviral vectors (LV) to overexpress the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in the right striatum of 2-month-old Sprague Dawley rats. A LV encoding for β-Galactosidase (LV-LacZ) was used as control. One month later, TSPO expression was measured by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using [125I]CLINDE. The fluorescence-activated cell sorting to radioligand-treated tissue (FACS-RTT) method was used to quantify TSPO levels in acutely sorted astrocytes, microglia, neurons and endothelial cells. A second cohort was injected with LV-CNTF and a LV encoding suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), to inhibit the JAK-STAT3 pathway specifically in astrocytes. GFAP and TSPO expressions were quantified by immunofluorescence. We measured a significant increase in TSPO signal in response to CNTF by SPECT imaging. Using FACS-RTT, we observed TSPO overexpression in reactive astrocytes (+ 153 ± 62%) but also in microglia (+ 2088 ± 500%) and neurons (+ 369 ± 117%), accompanied by an increase in TSPO binding sites per cell in those three cell populations. Endothelial cells did not contribute to TSPO signal increase. Importantly, LV-SOCS3 reduced CNTF-induced astrocyte reactivity and decreased global TSPO immunoreactivity (-71% ± 30%), suggesting that TSPO overexpression is primarily mediated by reactive astrocytes. Overall, this study reveals that CNTF induces TSPO in multiple cell types in the rat striatum, through the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in astrocytes, identifying this cell type as the primary mediator of CNTF effects neuroinflammatory processes. Our results highlight the difficulty to interpret TSPO imaging in term of cellular origin without addition cellular analysis by FACS-RTT or quantitative immunostainings.

However, SOM-IN activity changes and behavioral correlates during learning, and the role of mTORC1 in these processes, remain ill-defined. To address these questions, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging from SOM-INs during a virtual reality goal-directed spatial memory task in head-fixed control mice (SOM-IRES-Cre mice) or in mice with conditional knockout of Rptor (SOM-Rptor-KO mice) to block mTORC1 activity in SOM-INs. We found that control mice learn the task, but SOM-Raptor-KO mice exhibit a deficit. Also, SOM-IN Ca2+ activity became increasingly related to reward during learning in control mice but not in SOM-Rptor-KO mice. Four types of SOM-IN activity patterns related to reward location were observed, “reward off sustained”, “reward off transient”, “reward on sustained” and “reward on transient”, and these responses showed reorganization after reward relocation in control but not SOM-Rptor-KO mice.

Here we defined the crucial role of glutamatergic neurons within the lateral habenula nucleus (GluLHb) in itch modulation in mice. We established histamine-dependent and histamine-independent models of acute pruritus, as well as the acetone-ether-water (AEW) model of chronic pruritus. We first assessed the effects of pruritogen injection on neural activation in both medial and lateral divisions of LHb in vitro. We then demonstrated that the population activity of GluLHb neurons was increased during the acute itch and chronic itch-induced scratching behaviors in vivo. In addition, electrophysiological data showed that the excitability of GluLHb neurons was enhanced by chronic itch. Chemogenetic suppression of GluLHb neurons disrupted both acute and chronic itch-evoked scratching behaviors. Furthermore, itch-induced conditioned place aversion (CPA) was abolished by GluLHb neuronal inhibition. Finally, we dissected the LHb upstream brain regions.

Thus, we examined the effects of diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 activator, on depressive-like behavior using behavioral, pharmacological, and biochemical assays. To determine whether DIZE or Ang (1–7) produce antidepressant-like effects, we measured the duration of immobility of mice in the tail suspension test following their intracerebroventricular administration. Next, we measured the levels of ACE2 activation in the cerebral cortex, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala after DIZE injection, and examined which cell types, including neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, express ACE2 in the hippocampus using immunofluorescence. Administration of DIZE or Ang (1–7) significantly shortened the duration of immobility time in the tail suspension test, while this effect was inhibited by the co-administration of the MAS receptor antagonist A779. DIZE activated ACE2 in the hippocampus. ACE2 was localized to neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in the hippocampus. In conclusion, these results suggest that DIZE may act on ACE2-positive cells in the hippocampus where it increases the activity of ACE2, thereby enhancing signaling of the ACE2/Ang (1–7)/MAS receptor pathway and resulting in antidepressant-like effects.","c(""A tidepressa t"", ""A giote si -co verti g e zyme 2"", ""A g (1–7)"", ""Dimi aze e"", ""MAS receptor"")","Osamu Nakagawasai","osamun@tohoku-mpu.a.jp","13 June 2023"

Its unique physical position connecting CA1 and CA3 suggests the potential novel functions besides social memory regulation. But the CA2 is too small to be accurately targeted.

Recent genetic studies have identified a convergence of ASD risk genes in deep layer pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex. Here, we use retrograde recombinant adeno-associated viruses to label specifically two major layer V pyramidal neuron types of the medial prefrontal cortex: the commissural neurons, which put the two cerebral hemispheres in direct communication, and the corticopontine neurons, which transmit information outside the cortex. We compare the basal dendritic spines on commissural and corticopontine neurons in WT and KO mice for the ASD risk gene Itgb3, which encodes for the cell adhesion molecule β3 integrin selectively enriched in layer V pyramidal neurons. Regardless of the genotype, corticopontine neurons had a higher ratio of stubby to mushroom spines than commissural neurons. β3 integrin affected selectively spine length in corticopontine neurons. Ablation of β3 integrin resulted in corticopontine neurons lacking long (> 2 μm) thin dendritic spines. These findings suggest that a deficiency in β3 integrin expression compromises specifically immature spines on corticopontine neurons, thereby reducing the cortical territory they can sample. Because corticopontine neurons receive extensive local and long-range excitatory inputs before relaying information outside the cortex, specific alterations in dendritic spines of corticopontine neurons may compromise the computational output of the full cortex, thereby contributing to ASD pathophysiology.","c("" Itgb3 "", ""Medial prefro tal cortex"", ""ASD"", ""De dritic spi es"", ""Retrograde labelli g"")","Lorenzo A.

Although social deficits are at the core of the clinical diagnosis of ASD, very little is known about their neural correlates at the time of clinical onset. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region extensively implicated in social behavior, undergoes synaptic, cellular and molecular alterations in early life, and is particularly affected in ASD mouse models. To explore a link between the maturation of the NAc and neurodevelopmental deficits in social behavior, we compared spontaneous synaptic transmission in NAc shell medium spiny neurons (MSNs) between the highly social C57BL/6J and the idiopathic ASD mouse model BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J at postnatal day (P) 4, P6, P8, P12, P15, P21 and P30. BTBR NAc MSNs display increased spontaneous excitatory transmission during the first postnatal week, and increased inhibition across the first, second and fourth postnatal weeks, suggesting accelerated maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs compared to C57BL/6J mice. BTBR mice also show increased optically evoked medial prefrontal cortex-NAc paired pulse ratios at P15 and P30. These early changes in synaptic transmission are consistent with a potential critical period, which could maximize the efficacy of rescue interventions. To test this, we treated BTBR mice in either early life (P4-P8) or adulthood (P60-P64) with the mTORC1 antagonist rapamycin, a well-established intervention for ASD-like behavior.

The physiological significance of burst firings of hippocampal dentate GCs in synaptic plasticity remains unknown. We found that GCs with low input resistance could be categorized into regular-spiking (RS) and burst-spiking (BS) cells based on their initial firing frequency (Finit) upon somatic rheobase current injection, and investigated how two types of GCs differ in long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency lateral perforant pathway (LPP) inputs. Induction of Hebbian LTP at LPP synapses required at least three postsynaptic APs at Finit higher than 100 Hz, which was met in BS but not in RS cells. The synaptically evoked burst firing was critically dependent on persistent Na+ current, which was larger in BS than RS cells.

The GlyR subunits play major roles in the mammalian central nervous system, ranging from regulating simple sensory information to modulating higher-order brain function. Unlike the other GlyR subunits, GlyR α4 receives relatively little attention because the human ortholog lacks a transmembrane domain and is thus considered a pseudogene. A recent genetic study reported that the GLRA4 pseudogene locus on the X chromosome is potentially involved in cognitive impairment, motor delay and craniofacial anomalies in humans. The physiologic roles of GlyR α4 in mammal behavior and its involvement in disease, however, are not known. Here we examined the temporal and spatial expression profile of GlyR α4 in the mouse brain and subjected Glra4 mutant mice to a comprehensive behavioral analysis to elucidate the role of GlyR α4 in behavior. The GlyR α4 subunit was mainly enriched in the hindbrain and midbrain, and had relatively lower expression in the thalamus, cerebellum, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb. In addition, expression of the GlyR α4 subunit gradually increased during brain development. Glra4 mutant mice exhibited a decreased amplitude and delayed onset of the startle response compared with wild-type littermates, and increased social interaction in the home cage during the dark period. Glra4 mutants also had a low percentage of entries into open arms in the elevated plus-maze test. Although mice with GlyR α4 deficiency did not show motor and learning abnormalities reported to be associated in human genomics studies, they exhibited behavioral changes in startle response and social and anxiety-like behavior. Our data clarify the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the GlyR α4 subunit and suggest that glycinergic signaling modulates social, startle, and anxiety-like behaviors in mice.","c(""Glyci e receptor alpha 4 subu it"", ""Comprehe sive behavioral a alysis"", ""Startle disease"", ""Social behavior"", ""A xiety"", ""Muta t mice"", ""Brai "", ""Spatiotemporal expressio "")","Keizo Takao","takao@ts.u-toyama.a.jp","22 May 2023"

GABAergic interneurons are critical for generation of coordinated network activity in both neonatal and adult brain, yet the role of interneuronal KARs in network synchronization remains unclear. Here, we show that GABAergic neurotransmission and spontaneous network activity is perturbed in the hippocampus of neonatal mice lacking GluK1 KARs selectively in GABAergic neurons. Endogenous activity of interneuronal GluK1 KARs maintains the frequency and duration of spontaneous neonatal network bursts and restrains their propagation through the hippocampal network. In adult male mice, the absence of GluK1 in GABAergic neurons led to stronger hippocampal gamma oscillations and enhanced theta-gamma cross frequency coupling, coinciding with faster spatial relearning in the Barnes maze. In females, loss of interneuronal GluK1 resulted in shorter sharp wave ripple oscillations and slightly impaired abilities in flexible sequencing task. In addition, ablation of interneuronal GluK1 resulted in lower general activity and novel object avoidance, while causing only minor anxiety phenotype.

Here we sought to investigate the role of Ank2 in neuronal morphogenesis, learning and memory. We found that Ank2 is expressed widely throughout the Drosophila brain where it localizes predominantly to axon tracts. Pan-neuronal knockdown of Ank2 in the mushroom body, a region critical for memory formation, resulted in defects in axon morphogenesis. Similarly, reduction of Ank2 in lobular plate tangential neurons of the optic lobe disrupted dendritic branching and arborization. Conditional knockdown of Ank2 in the mushroom body of adult Drosophila significantly impaired long-term memory (LTM) of courtship suppression, and its expression was essential in the γ neurons of the mushroom body for normal LTM.

Primary cilia play critical roles in sensing the extracellular environment to coordinate various developmental and homeostatic signaling pathways. Here, we showed that the depletion of heat shock protein family A member 9 (HSPA9)/mortalin stimulates primary ciliogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells. The downregulation of HSPA9 enhances mitochondrial stress by increasing mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) generation. Notably, the inhibition of either mtROS production or mitochondrial fission significantly suppressed the increase in primary ciliogenesis in HSPA9-depleted cells. In addition, enhanced primary ciliogenesis contributed to cell survival by activating AKT in SH-SY5Y cells. The abrogation of ciliogenesis through the depletion of IFT88 potentiated neurotoxicity in HSPA9-knockdown cells. Furthermore, both caspase-3 activation and cell death were increased by MK-2206, an AKT inhibitor, in HSPA9-depleted cells.

Here, we developed a new paradigm for training and testing cooperative behavior in mice based on coordinated lever-pressing and analyzed social interactions between the animals during cooperation.

The recently developed flexible micro (μ)-electrocorticography (μECoG) device is one prominent method used to examine large-scale cortical activity across multiple regions. The sheet-shaped μECoG electrodes arrays can be placed on a relatively wide area of cortical surface beneath the skull by inserting the device into the space between skull and brain. Although rats and mice are useful tools for neuroscience, current μECoG recording methods in these animals are limited to the parietal region of cerebral cortex. Recording cortical activity from the temporal region of cortex in mice has proven difficult because of surgical barriers created by the skull and surrounding temporalis muscle anatomy. Here, we developed a sheet-shaped 64-channel μECoG device that allows access to the mouse temporal cortex, and we determined the factor determining the appropriate bending stiffness for the μECoG electrode array. We also established a surgical technique to implant the electrode arrays into the epidural space over a wide area of cerebral cortex covering from the barrel field to olfactory (piriform) cortex, which is the deepest region of the cerebral cortex. Using histology and computed tomography (CT) images, we confirmed that the tip of the μECoG device reached to the most ventral part of cerebral cortex without causing noticeable damage to the brain surface. Moreover, the device simultaneously recorded somatosensory and odor stimulus-evoked neural activity from dorsal and ventral parts of cerebral cortex in awake and anesthetized mice. These data indicate that our μECoG device and surgical techniques enable the recording of large-scale cortical activity from the parietal to temporal cortex in mice, including somatosensory and olfactory cortices.

Cognitive behavior was evaluated 3 days post-surgery using novel object recognition and fear conditioning. A gradual increase in the SOX2OT mRNA level and decrease in the SOX2 mRNA level were noted, with impaired cognitive function, in the mice 3 days after tibial surgery compared with mice in the sham group. To evaluate the role of SOX2OT in PND, SOX2OT knockdown was performed in vitro and in vivo using lentivirus transfection in HT22 cells and via brain stereotactic injection of lentivirus, respectively. SOX2OT knockdown reduced apoptosis, inhibited oxidative stress, suppressed mitochondrial hyperdivision, attenuated surgery-induced cognitive dysfunction, and promoted downstream SOX2 expression in elderly mice. Furthermore, Sox2 alleviated mitochondrial functional damage by inhibiting the transcription of mitochondrial division protein Drp1. Our study findings indicate that SOX2OT knockout alleviates surgery-induced mitochondrial fission and cognitive function defects by upregulating the expression of Sox2 in mice, resulting in the inhibition of drp1 transcription.

Recent studies have provided evidence for a link between the gut-brain axis and mood disorders. However, the effects of 5-HTT deficiency on gut microbiota, brain function, and behavior remain to be fully characterized. Here we investigated the effects of 5-HTT deficiency on different types of behavior, the gut microbiome, and brain c-Fos expression as a marker of neuronal activation in response to the forced swim test for assessing depression-related behavior in male 5-HTT knockout mice. Behavioral analysis using a battery of 16 different tests showed that 5-HTT−/− mice exhibited markedly reduced locomotor activity, decreased pain sensitivity, reduced motor function, increased anxiety-like and depression-related behavior, altered social behavior in novel and familiar environments, normal working memory, enhanced spatial reference memory, and impaired fear memory compared to 5-HTT+/+ mice. 5-HTT+/− mice showed slightly reduced locomotor activity and impaired social behavior compared to 5-HTT+/+ mice.

However, how the experience-dependent taste preference is developed and the neuronal mechanisms involved in this process are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of prolonged exposure to umami and bitter tastants on taste preference using two-bottle tests in male mice. Prolonged umami exposure significantly enhanced umami preference with no changes in bitter preference, while prolonged bitter exposure significantly decreased bitter avoidance with no changes in umami preference. Because the central amygdala (CeA) is postulated as a critical node for the valence processing of sensory information including taste, we examined the responses of cells in the CeA to sweet, umami, and bitter tastants using in vivo calcium imaging. Interestingly, both protein kinase C delta (Prkcd)-positive and Somatostatin (Sst)-positive neurons in the CeA showed an umami response comparable to the bitter response, and no difference in cell type-specific activity patterns to different tastants was observed. Meanwhile, fluorescence in situ hybridization with c-Fos antisense probe revealed that a single umami experience significantly activates the CeA and several other gustatory-related nuclei, and especially CeA Sst-positive neurons were strongly activated. Intriguingly, after prolonged umami experience, umami tastant also significantly activates the CeA neurons, but the Prkcd-positive neurons instead of Sst-positive neurons were highly activated. These results suggest a relationship between amygdala activity and experience-dependent plasticity developed in taste preference and the involvement of the genetically defined neural populations in this process.","c(""Gustatory circuit"", ""Umami"", ""Bitter"", ""Amygdala"", ""Taste prefere ce"", ""Plasticity"", ""Calcium imagi g"")","Ayako M.

However, IAPP aggregates, related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are toxic not only for the pancreas, but also for the brain. In the latter, IAPP is often found in vessels, where it is highly toxic for pericytes, mural cells that have contractile properties and regulate capillary blood flow. In the current study, we use a microvasculature model, where human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) are co-cultured together with human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, to demonstrate that IAPP oligomers (oIAPP) alter the morphology and contractility of HBVP. Contraction and relaxation of HBVP was verified using the vasoconstrictor sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and vasodilator Y27632, where the former increased, and the latter decreased, the number of HBVP with round morphology. Increased number of round HBVP was also seen after oIAPP stimulation, and the effect was reverted by the IAPP analogue pramlintide, Y27632, and the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin. Inhibition of the IAPP receptor with the antagonist AC187 only reverted IAPP effects partially. Finally, we demonstrate by immunostaining of human brain tissue against laminin that individuals with high amount of brain IAPP levels show significantly lower capillary diameter and altered mural cell morphology compared to individuals with low brain IAPP levels. These results indicate that HBVP, in an in vitro model of microvasculature, respond morphologically to vasoconstrictors, dilators, and myosin inhibitors. They also suggest that oIAPP induces contraction of these mural cells and that pramlintide can reverse such contraction.","c(""Amyli "", ""Vasculopathy"", ""Mural cells"", ""Diabetes"", ""Blood flow"")","Malin Wennström","malin.wennstrom@med.lu.se","15 February 2023"

The protein assembles a signalosome that differs in case of synaptic or extrasynaptic NMDAR activation. Following nuclear import Jacob docks these signalosomes to the transcription factor CREB. We have recently shown that amyloid-β and extrasynaptic NMDAR activation triggers the translocation of a Jacob signalosome that results in inactivation of the transcription factor CREB, a phenomenon termed Jacob-induced CREB shut-off (JaCS). JaCS contributes to early Alzheimer’s disease pathology and the absence of Jacob protects against amyloid pathology. Given that extrasynaptic activity is also involved in acute excitotoxicity, like in stroke, we asked whether nsmf gene knockout will also protect against acute insults, like oxygen and glucose deprivation and excitotoxic NMDA stimulation. nsmf is the gene that encodes for the Jacob protein. Here we show that organotypic hippocampal slices from wild-type and nsmf−/− mice display similar degrees of degeneration when exposed to either oxygen glucose deprivation or 50 µM NMDAto induce excitotoxicity.

In this study, we observed that Maged1 was expressed in the dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra in mice and humans, which could be upregulated by the in vivo or in vitro treatment with 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+). Genetic ablation of Maged1 in mice attenuated motor deficits, the loss of DA neurons, and disease progression induced by MPTP. Moreover, Maged1 deficiency protected DA neurons against MPP+-induced toxicity in primary cultured cells. Mechanistically, loss of Maged1 upregulated the Akt signaling pathway and downregulated the mTOR signaling pathway in SH-SY5Y cells, which may in turn attenuate the cell apoptosis and impairment of autophagy. Consistent with it, the degeneration of midbrain and striatum among elderly Maged1 knockout mice was relatively mild compared to those in wild-type mice under physiological conditions.

In this study, we used pharmacogenetic techniques to investigate whether concomitant activation of CRHPVN neurons could directly contribute to tumor progression.

Previous studies of PS function in the hippocampus demonstrated that loss of PS results in the impairment of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release at hippocampal Schaffer collateral (SC) and mossy fiber (MF) synapses. Cortical input to the hippocampus through the lateral perforant pathway (LPP) and the medial perforant pathway (MPP) is critical for normal cognitive functions and is particularly vulnerable during aging and early stages of AD. Whether PS regulates synaptic function in the perforant pathways, however, remained unknown. In the current study, we investigate PS function in the LPP and MPP by performing whole-cell and field-potential electrophysiological recordings using acute hippocampal slices from postnatal forebrain-restricted excitatory neuron-specific PS conditional double knockout (cDKO) mice. We found that paired-pulse ratio (PPR) is reduced in the LPP and MPP of PS cDKO mice. Moreover, synaptic frequency facilitation or depression in the LPP or MPP, respectively, is impaired in PS cDKO mice. Notably, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by inhibition of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) minics and occludes the effects of PS inactivation, as evidenced by decreases of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) amplitude in the LPP and MPP of control neurons but no effect on the EPSC amplitude in PS cDKO neurons, suggesting that impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis in the absence of PS may contribute to the observed deficits in synaptic transmission. While spontaneous synaptic events, such as both the frequency and the amplitude of spontaneous or miniature EPSCs, are similar between PS cDKO and control neurons, long-term potentiation (LTP) is impaired in the LPP and MPP of PS cDKO mice, accompanied with reduction of evoked NMDA receptor-mediated responses.

Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons are also innervated by the temporoammonic (TA) pathway, and excitatory TA-CA1 synapses are reported to be regulated by E2. Recent studies suggest a role for the novel G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1) at SC-CA1 synapses, however, the role of GPER1 in mediating the effects of E2 at juvenile TA-CA1 synapses is unclear. Here we demonstrate that the GPER1 agonist, G1 induces a persistent, concentration-dependent (1–10 nM) increase in excitatory synaptic transmission at TA-CA1 synapses and this effect is blocked by selective GPER1 antagonists. The ability of GPER1 to induce this novel form of chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP) was prevented following blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and it was not accompanied by any change in paired pulse facilitation ratio (PPR). GPER1-induced cLTP involved activation of ERK but was independent of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling. Prior treatment with philanthotoxin prevented the effects of G1, indicating that synaptic insertion of GluA2-lacking α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors underlies GPER1-induced cLTP. Furthermore, activity-dependent LTP occluded G1‐induced cLTP and vice versa, indicating that these processes have overlapping expression mechanisms. Activity‐dependent LTP was blocked by the GPER1 antagonist, G15, suggesting that GPER1 plays a role in NMDA‐dependent LTP at juvenile TA‐CA1 synapses.

The current antiseizure drugs (ASDs) aim to stop seizures quickly enough to prevent the SE-induced brain inflammation, injury, and long-term sequelae. However, sole reliance on acute therapies is imprudent because prompt treatment may not always be possible under certain circumstances. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the devastating consequences of SE are presumably associated with neuroinflammatory reactions, where prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays a pivotal role. As the terminal synthase for pathogenic PGE2, the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) is rapidly and robustly induced by prolonged seizures. Congenital deletion of mPGES-1 in mice is neuroprotective and blunts gliosis following chemoconvulsant seizures, suggesting the feasibility of mPGES-1 as a potential antiepileptic target. Herein, we investigated the effects of a dual species mPGES-1 inhibitor in a mouse pilocarpine model of SE. Treatment with the mPGES-1 inhibitor in mice after SE that was terminated by diazepam, a fast-acting benzodiazepine, time-dependently abolished the SE-induced PGE2 within the brain. Its negligible effects on cyclooxygenases, the enzymes responsible for the initial step of PGE2 biosynthesis, validated its specificity to mPGES-1. Post-SE inhibition of mPGES-1 also blunted proinflammatory cytokines and reactive gliosis in the hippocampus and broadly prevented neuronal damage in a number of brain areas. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of mPGES-1 by small-molecule inhibitors might provide an adjunctive strategy that can be implemented hours after SE, together with first-line ASDs, to reduce SE-provoked brain inflammation and injury.

Here we show the detailed mechanism of PDZD8-dependent lipophagy. PDZD8 transports cholesterol to lipid droplets (LDs), and eventually promotes fusion of LDs and lysosomes. In addition, PDZD8-KO mice exhibit growth retardation, hyperactivity, reduced anxiety and fear, increased sensorimotor gating, and impaired cued fear conditioned memory and working memory. These results indicate that abnormal CE accumulation in the brain caused by PDZD8 deficiency affects emotion, cognition and adaptive behavior, and that PDZD8 plays an important role in the maintenance of brain function through lipid metabolism.","c(""PDZD8"", ""K ockout mouse"", ""Behavior"", ""Dyslipidemia"", ""Lipophagy"", ""Cholesterol"")","Michiko Shirane","shiram@phar.nagoya-u.a.jp","19 January 2023"

Calcr neurons in the posterodorsal part of the medial amygdala (MeApd) are also activated by resocialization, however their role in social affiliation is still unclear.

Next, using an adeno-associated virus vector expressing a short hairpin RNA targeting Calcr we aimed to identify its molecular role in the MeApd. Inhibiting Calcr expression in the MeApd increased social contacts during resocialization without affecting locomotor activity, suggesting that the endogenous Calcr signaling in the MeApd suppresses social contacts.

Translation initiation factors play a cardinal role in gating the production of new proteins thereby regulating memory formation. Both positive and negative regulators of translation play a critical role in learning and memory consolidation. The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) homologous protein (4EHP, encoded by the gene Eif4e2) is a pivotal negative regulator of translation but its role in learning and memory is unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we generated excitatory (glutamatergic: CaMKIIα-positive) and inhibitory (GABAergic: GAD65-positive) conditional knockout mice for 4EHP, which were analyzed in various behavioral memory tasks. Knockout of 4EHP in Camk2a-expressing neurons (4EHP-cKOexc) did not impact long-term memory in either contextual fear conditioning or Morris water maze tasks. Similarly, long-term contextual fear memory was not altered in Gad2-directed 4EHP knockout mice (4EHP-cKOinh). However, when subjected to a short-term T-maze working memory task, both mouse models exhibited impaired cognition. We therefore tested the hypothesis that de novo protein synthesis plays a direct role in working memory. We discovered that phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a measure of mTORC1 activity, is dramatically reduced in the CA1 hippocampus of 4EHP-cKOexc mice. Consistently, genetic reduction of mTORC1 activity in either excitatory or inhibitory neurons was sufficient to impair working memory.

Recently, we demonstrated that K2P channels, TWIK-related K+ channel-1 (TREK-1), and TWIK-related arachidonic acid-activated K + channel (TRAAK), are highly expressed in the mammalian node of Ranvier of sensory nerves and have an important role in action potential repolarization instead of voltage-gated K+ channels. TREK-1/TRAAK channels are activated by membrane depolarization as well as various stimuli, such as temperature, pH, arachidonic acid, and mechanical membrane stretch. Although membrane mechanical stretch has been suggested to modulate action potential conduction, how membrane stretching modulates intrinsic electrophysiological properties at the node of Ranvier remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of membrane stretch on neuronal membranes at the node of Ranvier in rat sciatic nerves. The single-channel conductance was approximately 90 pS at 80 mV. Membrane stretch increased the single-channel event numbers and open probability in a pressure-dependent manner. Consistent with single-channel activity, intra-pipette positive pressure increased outward leak currents and decreased membrane excitability in a whole-cell configuration. Furthermore, blockage of TREK-1/TRAAK channels by Ba2+ reversed the changes in the intrinsic electrophysiological properties induced by intra-pipette pressure. These results indicate that the activation of mechanosensitive TREK-1/TRAAK channels may suppress neuronal excitability following axonal stretch. Our findings suggest that TREK-1/TRAAK channels may play an important role in the prevention of ectopic action potential discharge at the axon by intense mechanical nerve stretch under physiological conditions.","c(""Node of Ra vier"", ""Two-pore-domai potassium cha els"", ""Membra e stretch"", ""Actio pote tial"", ""Si gle-cha el activity"")","Hirosato Kanda","kanda@hyo-med.a.jp","17 January 2023"

A critical role in this degenerative process is assumed by enzymes such as the kinase Fyn and its counterpart, the phosphatase striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP61). Whereas the role of Fyn has been widely explored, less is known about STEP61 that localises to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of glutamatergic neurons. In dementias, synaptic loss is associated with an increased burden of pathological aggregates. Tau pathology is a hallmark of both AD (together with amyloid-β deposition) and FTD-tau. Here, we examined STEP61 and its activity in human and animal brain tissue and observed a correlation between STEP61 and disease progression. In early-stage human AD, an initial increase in the level and activity of STEP61 was observed, which decreased with the loss of the synaptic marker PSD-95; in FTD-tau, there was a reduction in STEP61 and PSD-95 which correlated with clinical diagnosis. In APP23 mice with an amyloid-β pathology, the level and activity of STEP61 were increased in the synaptic fraction compared to wild-type littermates. Similarly, in the K3 mouse model of FTD-tau, which we assessed at two ages compared to wild-type, expression and activity of STEP61 were increased with ageing. Together, these findings suggest that STEP contributes differently to the pathogenic process in AD and FTD-tau, and that its activation may be an early response to a degenerative process.","c(""Alzheimer’s disease"", ""Amyloid-β"", ""Fro totemporal deme tia"", ""Striatal-e riched tyrosi e phosphatase 61 (STEP61)"", ""Microtubule-associated protei tau"", ""Tra sge ic mice"")","Jürgen Götz","j.goetz@uq.edu.au","13 January 2023"

The circadian rhythm is a timed transcription-translation feedback loop with positive regulators, BMAL1 and CLOCK, that interact with negative regulators, CRY and PER, to regulate both the central and peripheral clocks. This review highlights the functions of the circadian rhythm, specifically in the blood–brain barrier (BBB), during both healthy and pathological states. The BBB is a highly selective dynamic interface composed of CNS endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and microglia that form the neurovascular unit (NVU). Circadian rhythms modulate BBB integrity through regulating oscillations of tight junction proteins, assisting in functions of the NVU, and modulating transporter functions. Circadian disruptions within the BBB have been observed in stress responses and several neurological disorders, including brain metastasis, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.

In the present study, we investigated synaptic tagging in adult and middle-aged mice's anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using the 64-channel multielectrode dish (MED64) recording system. We found that synaptic tagging was impaired in the ACC of middle-aged male mice as compared to adult mice.

Similar results were found in female middle-aged mice, indicating that there is no gender difference. Furthermore, bath application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or systemic treatment with newly developed TrkB receptor agonists R13, was shown to rescue both synaptic tagging, and L-LTP, in middle-aged mice. To determine the distribution of synaptic LTP within the ACC, a new visualization method was developed to map the Spatio-temporal variation of LTP in the ACC.

However, the temporal processing of nociceptive inputs in the cortex remains little studied. Here, we took two approaches to examine how nociceptive inputs are processed by the S1 and ACC. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials in both regions, during the application of a brain-computer interface (BCI). First, we compared event related potentials in the S1 and ACC. Next, we used an algorithmic pain decoder enabled by machine-learning to detect the onset of pain which was used during the implementation of the BCI to automatically treat pain. We found that whereas mechanical pain triggered neural activity changes first in the S1, the S1 and ACC processed thermal pain with a reasonably similar time course.

In addition, mTORC1-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of SOM-IN excitatory input synapses from local pyramidal cells (PC-SOM synapses) contributes to the consolidation of fear motivated spatial and contextual memories. Although, it remains unknown if SOM-IN activity and LTP are necessary and sufficient for novelty motivated spatial episodic memory such as the object location memory, and if so when it is required. Here we use optogenetics to examine whether dorsal CA1 SOM-IN activity and LTP are sufficient to regulate object location memory. First, we found that silencing SOM-INs during object location learning impaired memory. Second, optogenetic induction of PC-SOM synapse LTP (TBSopto) given 30 min before object location training, resulted in facilitation of memory. However, in mice with mTORC1 pathway genetically inactivated in SOM-INs, which blocks PC-SOM synapse LTP, TBSopto failed to facilitate object location memory.

Forebrain-specific conditional Cn knockout mice have been known to exhibit multiple behavioral phenotypes related to these disorders. In this study, we investigated whether Cn mutant mice show pseudo-immaturity of the dentate gyrus (iDG) in the hippocampus, which we have proposed as an endophenotype shared by these disorders. Expression of calbindin and GluA1, typical markers for mature DG granule cells (GCs), was decreased and that of doublecortin, calretinin, phospho-CREB, and dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1), markers for immature GC, was increased in Cn mutants. Phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) substrates (GluA1, ERK2, DARPP-32, PDE4) was increased and showed higher sensitivity to SKF81297, a Drd1-like agonist, in Cn mutants than in controls. While cAMP/PKA signaling is increased in the iDG of Cn mutants, chronic treatment with rolipram, a selective PDE4 inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP, ameliorated the iDG phenotype significantly and nesting behavior deficits with nominal significance. Chronic rolipram administration also decreased the phosphorylation of CREB, but not the other four PKA substrates examined, in Cn mutants. These results suggest that Cn deficiency induces pseudo-immaturity of GCs and that cAMP signaling increases to compensate for this maturation abnormality.

Using an enriched environment (EE) paradigm, we have recently demonstrated that enhancing social, physical, and sensory activity during the pre-weaning time in mice led to an increase of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. The structural plasticity induced by experience may affect information processing in the circuit. The DG performs pattern separation, a computation that enables the encoding of very similar and overlapping inputs into dissimilar outputs. In the presented study, we have tested the hypothesis that an EE in juvenile mice will affect DG’s functions that are relevant for pattern separation: the decorrelation of the inputs from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the recruitment of the principal excitatory granule cell (GC) during behavior. First, using a novel slice electrophysiology protocol, we found that the transformation of the incoming signal from the EC afferents by individual GC is moderately affected by EE. We further show that EE does not affect behaviorally induced recruitment of principal excitatory GC.

Recently, whole exome sequencing analysis of familial TN patients identified 19 rare variants in the gene CACNA1H encoding for Cav3.2T-type calcium channels.

In this study, we assessed the electrophysiological properties of 13 additional TN-associated Cav3.2 variants expressed in tsA-201 cells. Our data indicate that 6 out of the 13 variants analyzed display alteration of their gating properties as evidenced by a hyperpolarizing shift of their voltage dependence of activation and/or inactivation resulting in an enhanced window current supported by Cav3.2 channels. An additional variant enhanced the recovery from inactivation. Simulation of neuronal electrical membrane potential using a computational model of reticular thalamic neuron suggests that TN-associated Cav3.2 variants could enhance neuronal excitability.

In neurons, it has been well established that DA increases or decreases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) through D1-like or D2-like dopamine receptors, respectively. In contrast, it has been elusive how astrocytes respond to DA via Ca2+ signaling and regulate synaptic transmission and reward systems. Previous studies suggest various molecular targets such as MAO-B, D1R, or D1R–D2R heteromer to modulate astrocytic Ca2+ signaling. However, which molecular target is utilized under what physiological condition remains unclear. Here, we show that DA-induced astrocytic Ca2+ signaling pathway switches during development: MAO-B is the major player at a young age (5–6 weeks), whereas DA receptors (DARs) are responsible for the adult period (8–12 weeks). DA-mediated Ca2+ response in the adult period was decreased by either D1R or D2R blockers, which are primarily known for cyclic AMP signaling (Gs and Gi pathway, respectively), suggesting that this Ca2+ response might be mediated through Gq pathway by D1R–D2R heterodimer. Moreover, DAR-mediated Ca2+ response was not blocked by TTX, implying that this response is not a secondary response caused by neuronal activation.

OMP can enter the nucleus in association with transcription factors. However, how OMP is retained in the cytosol at rest is unclear. Because OMP is proposed to affect cell differentiation, it is important to understand how OMP is distributed between cytoplasm and nucleus. To elucidate the structural profile of OMP, we applied several bioinformatics methods to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of OMP protein sequences and ranked the evolutionarily conserved residues. In addition to the previously reported cAMP-binding domain, we identified a leucine-rich domain in the Ω-loop of OMP. We introduced mutations into the leucine-rich region and heterologously expressed the mutant OMP in HEK293T cells.

By performing a motif search, we detected possible calpain cleavage sites in OMP. However, the direct proteolytic regulation of OMP by CAPN5 is unclear. Here, we generated OMP fused with Myc-tag and His-tag at its N- and C-termini and examined whether CAPN5 cleaves OMP into fragments by detecting immunoreactivity against Myc, OMP and His. Western blotting demonstrated that OMP was unlikely to be cleaved even in the presence of Ca2+ in vitro. We expressed OMP and CAPN5 in HEK293T cells and applied a calcium ionophore under physiological conditions in cellulo, which resulted in no apparent fragmentation of OMP.

Neurol Genet. 2020;6:e512). While the majority (> 90%) of EOAD cases are not caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, they do have a higher heritability (92–100%) than sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD, 70%) (Wingo et al. Arch Neurol. 2012;69:59–64, Fulton-Howard et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2021;99:101.e1–101.e9). Although the endpoint clinicopathological changes, i.e., Aβ plaques, tau tangles, and cognitive decline, are common across EOAD and LOAD, the disease progression is highly heterogeneous (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). This heterogeneity, leading to temporally distinct age at onset (AAO) and stages of cognitive decline, may be caused by myriad combinations of distinct disease-associated molecular mechanisms. We and others have used transcriptome profiling in AD patient-derived neuron models of autosomal-dominant EOAD and sporadic LOAD to identify disease endotypes (Caldwell et al.

Further, analyses of large postmortem brain cohorts demonstrate that only one-third of AD patients show hallmark disease endotypes like increased inflammation and decreased synaptic signaling (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). Areas of the brain less affected by AD pathology at early disease stages—such as the primary visual cortex—exhibit similar transcriptomic dysregulation as those regions traditionally affected and, therefore, may offer a view into the molecular mechanisms of AD without the associated inflammatory changes and gliosis induced by pathology (Haroutunian et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2009;30:561–73). To this end, we analyzed AD patient samples from the primary visual cortex (19 EOAD, 20 LOAD) using transcriptomic signatures to identify patient clusters and disease endotypes.

To understand the neural mechanism of the state-dependent switch in multisensory decisions, we performed in vivo calcium imaging of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inhibitory neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are known to mediate auditory dominance in the resolution of audiovisual conflicts, in mice on the treadmill. In the stationary state, the PPC PV+ neurons showed similar amounts of evoked activity in responses to auditory and visual stimuli and enhanced responses to the multisensory audiovisual stimuli. Conversely, when mice were running on a treadmill, the PV+ neurons lost auditory responses and did not show any multisensory enhancement in their activity.

Excitatory synapses from PCs onto SOM-INs (PC-SOM synapses) exhibit long-term potentiation (LTP) mediated by type 1a metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1a). LTP at PC-SOM synapses translates in lasting regulation of metaplasticity of entorhinal and CA3 synaptic inputs on PCs and contributes to hippocampus-dependent learning. A persistent form of PC-SOM synapse LTP lasting hours is prevented by blockers of transcription and translation, and a more transient form of PC-SOM synapse LTP lasting tens of minutes requires mTORC1-signaling, suggesting an involvement of protein synthesis. However, the role of protein synthesis in these forms of plasticity has not been directly demonstrated. Here we use the SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET) assay of protein synthesis to directly show that the induction protocols for both forms of LTP at PC-SOM synapses stimulate protein synthesis in SOM-INs. Moreover, protein synthesis stimulated by persistent LTP induction was prevented in mice with a SOM-IN conditional knock-out of Raptor, an essential component of mTORC1, indicating a critical role of mTORC1 in the control of translation in PC-SOM synapse plasticity. Moreover, protein synthesis induced by both forms of LTP may share common mechanisms as transient LTP induction occluded further stimulation of protein synthesis by persistent LTP induction.

Tubby mice exhibit hearing impairment due to the loss of stereocilin from the tip regions that connect the tallest stereocilia of the outer hair cells (OHCs) to the tectorial membrane. Stereocilin is an essential stereociliary protein in the OHCs, the mutation of which in humans causes autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness. Map1a is a modifier of tubby hearing (moth1), and its wild-type allele, rather than the moth1 allele from the C57BL/6 J strain, restores stereocilin localization to the stereocilia and rescues the hearing impairment of tubby mice. The mechanism by which MAP1A accomplishes this is unclear, partly due to ambiguity regarding whether the tubby mutation is a true null. We therefore generated Tub-null (Tub−/−) mice by deleting exon 3 and found that they exhibit hearing impairment like that of tubby mice, suggesting the tubby mutation is a loss-of-function mutation with regard to hearing. When we crossed Tub−/− mice with AKR mice that have wild-type Map1a alleles, we found that wild-type MAP1A restores stereocilin localization to the tips of stereocilia and rescues hearing impairment. These data suggest MAP1A does not require interaction with tubby protein in maintaining stereocilin at the tips of stereocilia and that OHCs use two independent molecules—MAP1A and tubby—to doubly ensure proper stereocilin localization.","c(""Tubby"", ""MAP1A"", ""Stereocilia"", ""Stereocili "", ""Cochlear"")","Chul Hoon Kim","kimhoon@yuhs.a","14 September 2022"

Some studies have found increased beta amyloid burden is associated with worsening cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease, especially in cases where dementia occurs, while other studies failed to replicate this finding. To better understand this relationship, we examined a cohort of 25 idiopathic Parkinson’s disease patients and 30 healthy controls from the Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative database. These participants underwent [18F]Florbetaben positron emission tomography scans to quantify beta amyloid deposition in 20 cortical regions. We then analyzed this beta amyloid data alongside the longitudinal Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores across 3 years to see how participant’s baseline beta amyloid levels affected their cognitive scores prospectively. The first analysis we performed with these data was a hierarchical cluster analysis to help identify brain regions that shared similarity. We found that beta amyloid clusters differently in Parkinson’s disease patients compared to healthy controls. In the Parkinson’s disease group, increased beta amyloid burden in cluster 2 was associated with worse cognitive ability, compared to deposition in clusters 1 or 3. We also performed a stepwise linear regression where we found an adjusted R2 of 0.495 (49.5%) in a model explaining the Parkinson’s disease group’s Montreal Cognitive Assessment score 1-year post-scan, encompassing the left gyrus rectus, the left anterior cingulate cortex, and the right parietal cortex. Taken together, these results suggest regional beta amyloid deposition alone has a moderate effect on predicting future cognitive decline in Parkinson’s disease patients. The patchwork effect of beta amyloid deposition on cognitive ability may be part of what separates cognitive impairment from cognitive sparing in Parkinson’s disease. Thus, we suggest it would be more useful to measure beta amyloid burden in specific brain regions rather than using a whole-brain global beta amyloid composite score and use this information as a tool for determining which Parkinson’s disease patients are most at risk for future cognitive decline.","c(""Parki so ’s disease"", ""Beta amyloid"", ""Cog itive decli e"", ""[18F]Florbetabe "", ""PPMI"")","c(""Alexander S.

Animals, including humans, need to behave flexibly to adjust to ever-changing environments. Reversal learning tasks have been used to assess behavioral flexibility in many species. However, there are some limitations in the traditional free-moving methodology, including (1) sessions to train the animals, (2) within-session number of trials associated with reversals, (3) factors of physical movement unrelated to the task in the maze or operant box, and (4) incompatibility with techniques, such as two-photon imaging. Therefore, to address these limitations, we established a novel spatiotemporal Pavlovian head-fixed reversal learning task for mice. Six experimentally naive adult C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. First, we trained head-fixed mice on a fixed-time schedule task. Sucrose solution was delivered every 10 s with a single drinking spout placed within the licking distance of the mice. After the mice showed anticipatory licking toward the timing of sucrose solution delivery, we began training the mice on the fixed-time schedule reversal learning task with two licking spouts. In this task, sucrose solution was delivered through one of the two drinking spouts. The rewarding spout was switched every 10 trials. Mice quickly learned to switch anticipatory licking to the rewarding side of the spouts, suggesting that they learned this head-fixed reversal learning task. Using the head-fixed experimental design, behavioral measures can be simplified by eliminating the complex behavioral sequences observed in free-moving animals. This novel head-fixed reversal learning task is a useful assay for studying the neurobiological mechanism of behavioral flexibility that is impaired in various psychopathological conditions.","c(""Reversal lear i g"", ""Behavioral flexibility"", ""Head-fixed"", ""Pavlovia co ditio i g"", ""Mice"")","Koji Toda","koji@keio.jp","07 September 2022"

However, the causal relationship between nicotinic receptor activity and behavior remains unclear. Contrary to the studies that examined the functions of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, the role of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on behavior has not been examined as extensively. Here, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal injection of mecamylamine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, on the performance of male mice in a head-fixed temporal conditioning task and a free-moving open-field task. The head-fixed experimental setup allowed us to record and precisely quantify the licking response while the mice performed the behavioral task with no external cues. In addition, by combining the utility of the head-fixed experimental design with computer vision analysis based on deep learning algorithms, we succeeded in quantifying the eyelid size of awake mice. In the temporal conditioning task, we delivered a 10% sucrose solution every 10 s using a blunt-tipped needle placed within the licking distance of the mice. After the training, the mice showed increased anticipatory licking toward the timing of sucrose delivery, suggesting that the mice could predict the timing of the reward. Systemic injection of mecamylamine decreased licking behavior and caused eye closure but had no effect on learned conditioned predictive behavior in the head-fixed temporal conditioning task. In addition, the injection of mecamylamine decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner in the free-moving open-field task. The results in the open-field experiments further revealed that the effect of mecamylamine on fecal output and urination, suggesting the effects on autonomic activities. Our achievement of successful eyelid size recording has potential as a useful approach in initial screening for drug discovery.

However, relatively little is known about the changes in circuit function during the progression of motor deficit in this model. As the motor cortex is the key node in the motor system for the control of voluntary movement, we measured firing activity in populations of motor cortical neurons during locomotion on a motorized wheel-treadmill. Different populations of neurons intermingled in the motor cortex signal different aspects of the locomotor state of the animal. The proportion of running selective neurons whose activity positively correlates with locomotion speed gradually decreases with weekly training in wild-type mice, but not in Mecp2-null mice. The fraction of rest-selective neurons whose activity negatively correlates with locomotion speed does not change with training in wild-type mice, but is higher and increases with the progression of locomotion deficit in mutant mice.

Here, we subjected male and female C57BL/6J mice to DSS-induced colitis for 6 days, followed by Pavlovian conditioned fear (CF) tests 15 days after the start of inflammation, when local colonic inflammation has receded. The contextual and cued CF tests were used to assess associative fear memory. We found that DSS-induced colitis led to significant impairment in contextual fear memory in both male and female mice; on the other hand, auditory cued fear memories were comparable between control and DSS-treated mice. There were marked signs of astrogliosis in the hippocampal regions 17 days (D17) after colitis induction. Furthermore, molecular characterization of hippocampi showed marked but transient increases in the expression of inflammatory genes Nfkb, Trem2 (microglial marker), GFAP (astrocyte marker), Il1b, and S100a8 in DSS-treated mice. While the expression of Nfkb, Trem2, and GFAP showed a peak on day 10, the S100a8 expression was high on days 10 and 17 and subsided on day 42. Interestingly, expression of Bdnf remained elevated in the times assessed (D10, 17, 42).

It has previously been reported that persistent pain may be mediated by the immune and inflammatory systems. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a significant role in immune and inflammatory responses and are expressed by microglia and astrocytes. One of the fundamental mechanisms of the innate immune system in coordinating inflammatory signal transduction is through TLRs, which protect the host organism by initiating inflammatory signaling cascades in response to tissue damage or stress. TLRs reside at the neuroimmune interface, and accumulating evidence has suggested that the inflammatory consequences of TLR activation on glia (mainly microglia and astrocytes), sensory neurons, and other cell types can influence nociceptive processing and lead to pain. Several studies have shown that TLRs may play a key role in neuropathic pain and migraine etiology by activating the microglia. The pathogenesis of migraine may involve a TLR-mediated crosstalk between neurons and immune cells. Innate responses in the central nervous system (CNS) occur during neuroinflammatory phenomena, including migraine. Antigens found in the environment play a crucial role in the inflammatory response, causing a broad range of diseases, including migraines. These can be recognized by several innate immune cells, including macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells, and can be activated through TLR signaling. Given the prevalence of migraine and the insufficient efficacy and safety of current treatment options, a deeper understanding of TLRs is expected to provide novel therapies for managing chronic migraine.

This posttranslational modification controls key cellular processes, such as the degradation, endocytosis, subcellular localization and activity of proteins. Ubiquitination, which can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays important roles during brain development. Furthermore, deregulation of the Ub system is linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. We used a publicly available RNA-seq database to perform an extensive genome-wide gene expression analysis of the core components of the ubiquitination machinery, covering Ub genes as well as E1, E2, E3 and DUB genes. The ubiquitination network was governed by only Uba1 and Ube2m, the predominant E1 and E2 genes, respectively; their expression was positively regulated during cortical formation. The principal genes encoding HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus), RBR (RING-in-between-RING), and RING (really interesting new gene) E3 Ub ligases were also highly regulated. Pja1, Dtx3 (RING ligases) and Stub1 (U-box RING) were the most highly expressed E3 Ub ligase genes and displayed distinct developmental expression patterns. Moreover, more than 80 DUB genes were expressed during corticogenesis, with two prominent genes, Uch-l1 and Usp22, showing highly upregulated expression. Several components of the Ub system overexpressed in cancers were also highly expressed in the cerebral cortex under conditions not related to tumour formation or progression. Altogether, this work provides an in-depth overview of transcriptomic changes during embryonic formation of the cerebral cortex.

However, functions of these channels at NRs remain elusive. In the present study, we addressed this issue by directly applying whole-cell patch-clamp recordings at NRs of rat lumbar spinal ventral nerves in ex vivo preparations. We show that depolarizing voltages evoke large non-inactivating outward currents at NRs, which are partially inhibited by KCNQ channel blocker linopirdine and potentiated by KCNQ channel activator retigabine. Furthermore, linopirdine significantly alters intrinsic electrophysiological properties of NRs to depolarize resting membrane potential, increase input resistance, prolong AP width, reduce AP threshold, and decrease AP amplitude. On the other hand, retigabine significantly decreases input resistance and increases AP rheobase at NRs. Moreover, linopirdine increases excitability at NRs by converting single AP firing into multiple AP firing at many NRs. Saltatory conduction velocity is significantly reduced by retigabine, and AP success rate at high stimulation frequency is significantly increased by linopirdine. Collectively, KCNQ2 channels play a significant role in regulating intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of motor nerve fibers of rats. These findings may provide insights into how the loss-of-function mutation in KCNQ2 channels can lead to neuromuscular disorders in human patients.","c(""Node of Ra vier"", ""Voltage-gated K+ cha el"", ""KCNQ2 cha el"", ""Kv7.2 cha els"", ""Actio pote tial"", ""Saltatory co ductio "", ""Motor erves"")","Jianguo G.

We also compared canonical pathway activation associated with either total proteins or phosphoproteins and revealed that they both are upregulated at 24 weeks. However, at 3 weeks post-TBI, only pathways associated with total proteins are upregulated, while pathways driven by phosphoproteins are downregulated. Finally, to assess the translatability of our data, we compared proteomic changes in our mouse model with those reported in autopsied human samples of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) patients compared to controls. We observed 39 common proteins that were upregulated in both species and 24 common pathways associated with these proteins. These findings support the translational relevance of our mouse model of r-mTBI for successful identification and translation of therapeutic targets.","list()","Alexander Morin","amorin@roskampinstitute.org","18 July 2022"

There is incomplete knowledge of how the concentration of these proteins differs between anatomical regions in the CNS as previous studies have focused on gene expression or non-quantitative protein analyses, limiting the interpretability of these biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to create a map of the tissue content of these proteins in different regions of the CNS. The concentrations of the investigated proteins were determined with ELISA in post mortem tissue homogenates from 17 selected anatomical regions in the CNS from ten deceased donors aged 24 to 50 years. When appropriate, the protein concentrations were adjusted for post-mortem interval. In total, 168 tissue samples were analysed. There was a substantial variation in the concentrations of GFAP, MBP, NFL, tau and UCHL1 between different CNS regions. Highly myelinated areas of the CNS had tenfold higher MBP concentration than cerebral cortex, whereas tau showed an inverse pattern. GFAP, NFL and tau displayed an anteroposterior gradient in cerebral white matter. The cerebellum had low concentrations of all the investigated proteins. In conclusion, the tissue concentrations of GFAP, MBP, NFL, tau and UCHL1 were determined throughout the CNS.

Ferroptosis has been reported to play an important role in neuron damage in several nervous system diseases. However, the occurrence of ferroptosis in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) pathogenesis is still unknown. In this study, we firstly detected increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron, which are indicators of ferroptosis, in the cerebrum of ECM mice. Some important regulators of ferroptosis, including upregulated expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), and downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) levels, were also confirmed in ECM mice. Consistently, neuron damage, which was detected in the cerebrum of ECM mice, was positively correlated with reduced GPX4 expression and furtherly rescued by administration of the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). In addition, primary neurons were damaged by activated CD8+ T cells, an effect that was also partially rescued by Fer-1 on amyloid precursor protein expression and mitochondrial membrane potential levels in vitro. Activated CD8+ T cells were also shown to infiltrate the cerebrum of ECM mice and upregulate TfR1 expression in primary neurons, which may be an important event for inducing ferroptosis in ECM. Altogether, we show that ferroptosis contributes to neuron damage in ECM pathogenesis, and activated CD8+ T cells may be important inducers of neuronal ferroptosis. Hence, targeting ferroptosis may be a promising adjuvant therapeutic strategy for neurological sequelae in patients with cerebral malaria.","c(""ACSL4"", ""CD8+ T cell"", ""Cerebral malaria"", ""Ferroptosis"", ""GPX4"", ""Neuro "", ""TfR1"")","c(""Yinghui Li"", ""Ya Zhao"")","""yinghlzb@fmmu.edu.n"", ""zhaoya@fmmu.edu.n""","20 June 2022"

PV INs receive excitatory inputs from CA3 Schaffer collaterals and local CA1 pyramidal cells, and they provide perisomatic inhibition. Schaffer collateral excitatory synapses onto PV INs express Hebbian and anti-Hebbian types of long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as elicit LTP of intrinsic excitability (LTPIE). LTPIE requires the activation of type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5) and is mediated by downregulation of potassium channels Kv1.1. It is sensitive to rapamycin and thus may involve activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). LTPIE facilitates PV INs recruitment in CA1 and maintains an excitatory-inhibitory balance. Impaired CA1 PV INs activity or LTP affects network oscillations and memory. However, whether LTPIE in PV INs plays a role in hippocampus-dependent memory remains unknown. Here, we used conditional deletion of the obligatory component of mTORC1, the Regulatory-Associated Protein of mTOR (Raptor), to directly manipulate mTORC1 in PV INs. We found that homozygous, but not heterozygous, conditional knock-out of Rptor resulted in a decrease in CA1 PV INs of mTORC1 signaling via its downstream effector S6 phosphorylation assessed by immunofluorescence. In whole-cell recordings from hippocampal slices, repetitive firing of CA1 PV INs was impaired in mice with either homozygous or heterozygous conditional knock-out of Rptor. High frequency stimulation of Schaffer collateral inputs that induce LTPIE in PV INs of control mice failed to do so in mice with either heterozygous or homozygous conditional knock-out of Rptor in PV INs. At the behavioral level, mice with homozygous or heterozygous conditional knock-out of Rptor showed similar long-term contextual fear memory or contextual fear memory discrimination relative to control mice. Thus, mTORC1 activity in CA1 PV INs regulates repetitive firing and LTPIE but not consolidation of long-term contextual fear memory and context discrimination. Our results indicate that mTORC1 plays cell-specific roles in synaptic plasticity of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons that are differentially involved in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.

While growing, axons are guided by molecular cues to their final destination, where they establish synaptic connections with other neuronal cells. Several layers of regulation are integrated to control neuronal development properly. Although control of mRNA translation plays an essential role in mammalian gene expression, how it contributes temporarily to the modulation of later stages of neuronal differentiation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how translation control affects pathways and processes essential for neuronal maturation, using H9-derived human neuro progenitor cells differentiated into neurons as a model. Through Ribosome Profiling (Riboseq) combined with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis, we found that translation control regulates the expression of critical hub genes. Fundamental synaptic vesicle secretion genes belonging to SNARE complex, Rab family members, and vesicle acidification ATPases are strongly translationally regulated in developing neurons. Translational control also participates in neuronal metabolism modulation, particularly affecting genes involved in the TCA cycle and glutamate synthesis/catabolism. Importantly, we found translation regulation of several critical genes with fundamental roles regulating actin and microtubule cytoskeleton pathways, critical to neurite generation, spine formation, axon guidance, and circuit formation. Our results show that translational control dynamically integrates important signals in neurons, regulating several aspects of its development and biology.","c(""Tra slatio al co trol"", ""Neural stem cells"", ""Neuro "", ""Neuro al differe tiatio "")","Mário Henrique Bengtson","bengtson@g.uniamp.br","15 June 2022"

Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) negatively regulates dopamine signaling in the striatum, suggesting a critical role of CDK5 in circadian and sleep disorders. Here, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing to produce mice with a dorsal striatum (DS)-specific knockdown (KD) of the Cdk5 gene (referred to as DS-CDK5-KD mice) and investigate its role in vivo. DS-CDK5-KD mice exhibited deficits in locomotor activity and disturbances in activity/rest behavior. Additionally, Golgi staining of neurons in the DS revealed that CDK5 deletion reduced dendrite length and the number of functional synapses, which was confirmed by significant downregulation of MAP2, PSD-95, and synapsin I. Correlated with this, DS-CDK5-KD mice displayed reduced phosphorylation of Tau at Thr181. Furthermore, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of green fluorescent protein-tagged neurons in the striatum of DS-CDK5-KD mice revealed a decreased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents and altered excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance. Notably, anterograde labeling showed that CDK5 KD in the DS disrupted long-range projections to the secondary motor cortex, dorsal and ventral thalamic nuclei, and basolateral amygdala, which are involved in the regulation of motor and circadian rhythms in the brain.

Arginine vasopressin-producing neurons are among the major neuronal populations in the PVH (PVHAVP), which play important roles in water homeostasis, blood pressure regulation, feeding, and stress response. Here, we report the critical role of PVHAVP neurons in the induction of self-grooming. Optogenetic activation of PVHAVP neurons immediately induced self-grooming in freely moving mice. Chemogenetic activation of these neurons also increased time spent self-grooming. In contrast, their chemogenetic inhibition significantly reduced naturally occurring self-grooming, suggesting that PVHAVP-induced grooming has physiological relevance. Notably, optogenetic activation of PVHAVP neurons triggered self-grooming over other adaptive behaviors, such as voracious feeding induced by fasting and social interaction with female mice. Thus, our study proposes the novel role of PVHAVP neurons in regulating self-grooming behavior and, consequently, hygiene maintenance and stress response.

We measured the mRNA levels of OXT, OXT receptor (OXTR), vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), and piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (Piezo2) in single DRG neurons by using real-time PCR, and then performed a cluster analysis. According to the gene expression patterns, DRG neurons were classified into 4 clusters: Cluster 1 was characterized mainly by Piezo2, Cluster 2 by TRPV1, Cluster 4 by OXTR, and neurons in Cluster 3 did not express any of the target genes. The cell body diameter of OXT-expressing neurons was significantly larger in Cluster 1 than in Cluster 2. These results suggest that OXT-expressing DRG neurons with small cell bodies (Cluster 2) and large cell bodies (Cluster 1) probably correspond to C-fiber neurons and Aβ-fiber neurons, respectively. Furthermore, the OXT-expressing neurons contained not only TRPV1 but also Piezo2, suggesting that OXT may be released by mechanical stimulation regardless of nociception. Thus, mechanoreception and nociception themselves may induce the autocrine/paracrine function of OXT in the DRG, contributing to alleviation of pain.","list()","Etsuro Ito","eito@waseda.jp","09 May 2022"

Here, we have investigated the impact of CaVβ1b and CaVβ2a subunits on plasma membrane trafficking of CaV1.2 using a live-labeling strategy. We show that the CaVβ1b subunit is more potent in increasing CaV1.2 expression at the plasma membrane than the CaVβ2a subunit and that this effect is not related to modification of intracellular trafficking of the channel (i.e. neither forward trafficking, nor recycling, nor endocytosis).

Oral administration of KDS2010 effectively relieved PTX-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. KDS2010 (25 mg/Kg) significantly prevented and suppressed PTX-induced pain responses with minimal effects on the body weight, motor activity, and working memory. KDS2010 significantly reduced reactive astrocytosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the L4–L6 spinal cord of PTX-treated mice. Furthermore, KDS2010 reversed the attenuation of GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequency in spinal dorsal horn neurons, although it failed to restore the reduced tonic GABAA inhibition nor the increased GABA transporter 1 (GAT1) expression in PTX-treated mice. In addition, bath application of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger (PBN) restored the sIPSC frequency in PTX-treated mice but not in control and PTX + KDS2010-treated mice. These results indicated that the antiallodynic effect of KDS2010 is not due to a MAO-B-dependent GABA production. Finally, PBN alone also exerted a similar analgesic effect as KDS2010, but a co-treatment of PBN with KDS2010 showed no additive effect, suggesting that inhibition of MAO-B-dependent ROS production is responsible for the analgesic effect by KDS2010 on PTX-induced allodynia. Overall, KDS2010 attenuated PTX-induced pain behaviors by restoring the altered ROS level and GABAergic inhibitory signaling in the spinal cord, suggesting that KDS2010 is a promising therapeutic strategy for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.","c(""KDS2010"", ""MAO-B"", ""Tactile Hyperse sitivity"", ""Paclitaxel"")","Jin Bong Park","jbpark@snu.a.kr","07 May 2022"

Functioning as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) regulates the expression of protein-coding genes in a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. However, the lncRNA-associated ceRNA in TBI remains unclear. In this study, we processed the raw SRR files of mice cortex samples of sham injury (n = 3) and TBI groups (n = 3) to count files. Then, the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified, and 86 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 1201 DEmRNAs between sham and TBI groups were identified. The DEmRNAs were used to perform enrichment analyses. Next, a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory ceRNA network was constructed. The network consisted of 23 mRNAs, 5 miRNAs and 2 lncRNAs. The expression alternations of the 5 miRNAs were validated via qRT-PCR. The subnetwork of hub lncRNA Neat1 was extracted. We identified a potential inflammatory associated regulatory axis: Neat1/miR-31-5p/Myd88 axis. The PPI network based on DEmRNA involved in ceRNA network was constructed PPI networks to identify the hub genes. Finally, DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs were selected randomly and validated by qRT-PCR.

Numerous studies have also found adult neurogenesis in the human hippocampus, but several recent high-profile studies have suggested that this process is considerably reduced in humans, occurring in children but not in adults. In comparison, rodent studies also show age-related decline but a greater degree of proliferation of new neurons in adult animals. These differences may represent biological species differences or could alternatively be explained by methodological differences in tissue handling and fixation. Here, we examine whether differences in the post-mortem interval between death and tissue fixation might impact subsequent detection of adult neurogenesis due to increased tissue degradation. Because there are fewer new neurons present in older subjects to begin with we hypothesized that, subject age might interact significantly with post-mortem interval in the detection of adult neurogenesis. We analyzed neurogenesis in the hippocampus of rats that were either perfusion-fixed or the brains extracted and immersion-fixed at various post-mortem intervals. We observed an interaction between animal age and the time delay between death and tissue fixation. While similar levels of neurogenesis were observed in young rats regardless of fixation, older rats had significantly fewer labeled neurons when fixation was not immediate. Furthermore, the morphological detail of the labeled neurons was significantly reduced in the delayed fixation conditions at all ages.

In this study, we demonstrated that the DHA treatment on newborn rats significantly relieved the neuron loss and motor and cognitive impairment caused by HIBD.

However, in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the role of Rufy3 has not been investigated. Consequently, we aimed to investigate the potential role of Rufy3 in an in vivo model of SAH-induced early brain injury (EBI). In addition, we investigated the relevant brain-protective mechanisms. Oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) stimulation of cultured primary neurons simulated vitro SAH condition. The SAH rat model was induced by infusing autologous blood into the optic chiasma pool and treating the rats with lentivirus-negative control 1 (LV-NC1), lentivirus-Rufy3 shRNA (LV-shRNA), lentivirus-negative control 2 (LV-NC2), lentivirus-Rufy3 (LV-Rufy3), or 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (8p-CPT) (Rap1 agonist). In experiment one, we found that the protein level of Rufy3 decreased and neuronal axon injury in the injured neurons but was rectified by LV-Rufy3 treatment. In experiment two, mRNA and protein levels of Rufy3 were downregulated in brain tissue and reached the lowest level at 24 h after SAH. In addition, the expression of Myelin Basic Protein was downregulated and that of anti-hypophosphorylated neurofilament H (N52) was upregulated after SAH. In experiments three and four, Rufy3 overexpression (LV-Rufy3) increased the interactions between Rufy3 and Rap1, the level of Rap1-GTP, and the ratio of Rap1-GTP/total GTP. In addition, LV-Rufy3 treatment inhibited axon injury and accelerated axon repair by activating the Rap1/Arap3/Rho/Fascin signaling pathway accompanied by upregulated protein expression levels of ARAP3, Rho, Fascin, and Facin. LV-Rufy3 also enhanced synaptic plasticity by activating the Rap1/MEK/ERK/synapsin I signaling pathway accompanied by upregulated protein expression levels of ERK1, p-ERK1, MEK1, p-MEK1, synaspin I, and p-synaspin I. Moreover, LV-Rufy3 also alleviated brain damage indicators, including cortical neuronal cell apoptosis and degeneration, brain edema, and cognitive impairment after SAH. However, the downregulation of Rufy3 had the opposite effect and aggravated EBI induced by SAH. Notably, the combined application of LV-Rufy3 and 8p-CPT showed a significant synergistic effect on the aforementioned parameters.

The 3q29 microdeletion (3q29del), a recurrent copy number variant, confers a high risk for ASD and schizophrenia, and serves as an important pathological model for investigating the molecular pathogenesis of a large number of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. Recently, mouse models carrying a deletion of the chromosomal region corresponding to the human 3q29 region (Df/+ mice) were generated and demonstrated neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions associated behavioral abnormalities, pointing to the relevance of Df/+ mice as a model for these conditions with high construct and face validity. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis of these behavioral phenotypes in Df/+ mice remains unclear. The oxytocin (OXT) system plays a central role in social behavior across species and has a potential role in ASD. In this study, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind impaired social behavior in Df/+ mice, we investigated the possible involvement of OXT signaling in impaired social behavior in Df/+ mice. We demonstrated that OXT administration restored the impaired social behavior in Df/+ mice. We also demonstrated that the number of OXT-positive cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was significantly lower in Df/+ mice than in wild-type (WT) littermates. Consistent with this, the level of OXT peptide in the cerebral cortex of Df/+ mice was lower than in WT littermates.

This includes elements from multiple different families and subfamilies of retrotransposons, however there is limited knowledge of the specific loci from which this expression occurs in ALS. The long interspersed element-1 (L1) is the only autonomous retrotransposon in the human genome and members of this family of elements maintain the ability to mobilise. Despite L1s contributing to 17% of the human genome only 80–100 L1s encode the required proteins for mobilisation and are retrotransposition competent. Identifying the specific loci from which L1 expression occurs will inform on the potential functional consequences of their expression, such as the potential for somatic retrotransposition or DNA damage caused by the endonuclease activity of the ORF2 protein of the L1. Here we characterised L1 loci expression using the L1EM tool (https://github.com/FenyoLab/L1EM) in RNA sequencing data from 518 samples across four tissues (motor cortex, frontal cortex, cerebellum and cervical spinal cord) in the Target ALS cohort obtained from the New York Genome Center. There was a significant reduction in total intact L1 expression (those that encode functional proteins) in two brain regions of individuals with ALS compared to controls and clustering of the ALS brain regions occurred based on their intact L1 expression profile. Although overall the levels of L1 expression were reduced in ALS/ALS with other neurological disorder (ND) there were individuals in which L1s were expressed at much higher levels than the rest of the ALS/ALSND cohort. Expressed L1 loci were more frequently located in introns compared to those not expressed and the level of L1 expression positively correlated with the expression of the gene in which it was located.

One approach to exploit these interactions therapeutically is to target the pathways that regulate metabolism. In this respect, the nutrient-sensing hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is of particular interest since it introduces a protein post-translational modification known as O-GlcNAcylation, which modifies different proteins in control versus neurodegenerative disease postmortem brains. A potent inhibitor of the O-GlcNAcase enzyme that removes the modification from proteins, Thiamet G (TG), has been proposed to have potential benefits in Alzheimer’s disease. We tested whether key factors in the O-GlcNAcylation are correlated with mitochondrial electron transport and proteins related to the autophagy/lysosomal pathways in the cortex of male and female mice with and without exposure to TG (10 mg/kg i.p.). Mitochondrial complex activities were measured in the protein homogenates, and a panel of metabolic, autophagy/lysosomal proteins and O-GlcNAcylation enzymes were assessed by either enzyme activity assay or by western blot analysis. We found that the networks associated with O-GlcNAcylation enzymes and activities with mitochondrial parameters, autophagy-related proteins as well as neurodegenerative disease-related proteins exhibited sex and TG dependent differences. Taken together, these studies provide a framework of interconnectivity for multiple O-GlcNAc-dependent pathways in mouse brain of relevance to aging and sex/age-dependent neurodegenerative pathogenesis and response to potential therapies.

The current hypothesis predicts simultaneous excitation of cataplexy-inhibiting orexin neurons and cataplexy-inducing amygdala neurons. To test this hypothesis, we measured the activity of putative orexin neurons in orexin-knockout mice during cataplexy episodes using fiber photometry. We created two animal models of orexin-knockout mice with a GCaMP6 fluorescent indicator expressed in putative orexin neurons. We first prepared orexin-knockout mice crossed with transgenic mice carrying a tetracycline-controlled transactivator transgene under the control of the orexin promoter. TetO-GCaMP6 was then introduced into mice via an adeno-associated virus injection or natural crossing. The resulting two models showed restricted expression of GCaMP6 in the hypothalamus, where orexin neurons should be located, and showed excitation to an intruder stress that was similar to that observed in orexin-intact mice in our previous study. The activity of these putative orexin neurons increased immediately before the onset of cataplexy-like behavior but decreased (approximately − 20% of the baseline) during the cataplexy-like episode. We propose that the activity of orexin neurons during cataplexy is moderately inhibited by an unknown mechanism. The absence of cataplexy in wild-type mice may be explained by basal or residual activity-induced orexin release, and emotional stimulus-induced counter activation of orexin neurons may not be necessary.

Even though excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance has been suggested as an underlying mechanism of ASD, few studies have investigated the actual ratio of glutamate (Glu) to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration in vivo. Moreover, there are controversies in the directions of E/I ratio alterations even in extensively studied ASD animal models. Here, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at 9.4T, we found significant differences in the levels of different metabolites or their ratios in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of Cntnap2−/− mice compared to their wild-type littermates. The Glu/GABA ratio, N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/total creatine (tCr) ratio, and tCr level in the prefrontal cortex were significantly different in Cntnap2−/− mice compared to those in wild-type mice, and they significantly correlated with the sociability of mice. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses indicated high specificity and selectivity of these metabolites in discriminating genotypes. These results suggest that the lowered Glu/GABA ratio in the prefrontal cortex along with the changes in the other metabolites might contribute to the social behavior deficit in Cntnap2−/− mice.

The extracellular/luminal moiety of SorLA has a unique mosaic domain composition and interacts with a large number of different and partially unrelated ligands, including the amyloid precursor protein as well as amyloid-β. Several studies support a strong association of SorLA with sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although SorLA seems to be an important factor in AD, the large number of different ligands suggests a role as a neuronal multifunctional receptor with additional intracellular sorting capacities. Therefore, understanding the determinants of SorLA’s subcellular targeting might be pertinent for understanding neuronal endosomal sorting mechanisms in general. A number of cytosolic adaptor proteins have already been demonstrated to determine intracellular trafficking of SorLA. Most of these adaptors and several ligands of the extracellular/luminal moiety are shared with the Vps10p-D receptor Sortilin. Although SorLA and Sortilin show both a predominant intracellular and endosomal localization, they are targeted to different endosomal compartments. Thus, independent adaptor proteins may convey their differential endosomal targeting. Here, we hypothesized that Sortilin and SorLA interact with the cytosolic adaptors PSD95 and PICK1 which have been shown to bind the Vps10p-D receptor SorCS3. We observed only an interaction for SorLA and PICK1 in mammalian-two-hybrid, pull-down and cellular recruitment experiments. We demonstrate by mutational analysis that the C-terminal minimal PDZ domain binding motif VIA of SorLA mediates the interaction. Moreover, we show co-localization of SorLA and PICK1 at vesicular structures in primary neurons. Although the physiological role of the interaction between PICK1 and SorLA remains unsolved, our study suggests that PICK1 partakes in regulating SorLA’s intracellular itinerary.","c(""SorLA"", ""Sorti g receptor"", ""Vps10p-domai "", ""PICK1"", ""PDZ-domai "", ""Protei i teractio "", ""Neuro al e dosomal sorti g a d trafficki g"")","Guido Hermey","guido.hermey@zmnh.uni-hamburg.de","19 February 2022"

The activation of dopamine receptors in neurons in the nucleus accumbens by the release of endogenous dopamine is thus expected to contribute to efferent immune regulation. As in the stimulation of Gs-coupled dopamine D1-receptors or Gi-coupled D2-receptors by endogenous dopamine, we investigated whether specific stimulation of dopamine D1-receptor-expressing neurons or inhibition of dopamine D2-receptor-expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens could produce anti-tumor effects and improve the immune system in transgenic mice using pharmacogenetic techniques. Repeated stimulation of D1-receptor-expressing neurons in either the medial shell, lateral shell or core regions of the nucleus accumbens significantly decreased tumor volume under a state of tumor transplantation, whereas repeated suppression of D2-receptor-expressing neurons in these areas had no effect on this event. The number of splenic CD8+ T cells was significantly increased following repeated stimulation of D1-receptor-expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens of mice with tumor transplantation. Furthermore, this stimulation produced a significant reduction in the population of splenic CD8+ T cells that expressed immune checkpoint-related inhibitory receptors, PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3.

The rapid advancement of massively parallel sequencing has resulted in the identification of more than 40 new mutations in COQ8A and functional studies are required to confirm causality and to further research into determining the specific mechanisms through which the mutations result in loss of function. To that end, a Drosophila model of Coq8 deficiency was developed and characterized to determine its appropriateness as a model system to further explore the role of Coq8 in the brain, and for functional characterisation of Coq8 mutations. Pan-neuronal RNAi knockdown of Coq8 was largely lethal, with female escapers displaying severe locomotor deficits. Knockdown of Coq8 in the eye resulted in degeneration of photoreceptors, progressive necrosis and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Reintroduction of wild-type Coq8 restored normal function, however expression of human wild-type COQ8A exacerbated the eye phenotype, suggesting it was acting as a dominant-negative.

Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosome-dependent process in which eukaryotic cells removal misfolded proteins and damaged organelles in cytoplasm, which is critical for energy metabolism, organelle renewal, and maintenance of intracellular homeostasis. Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy plays important roles in pathophysiological mechanisms under ischemic conditions. However, there are still controversies about whether autophagy plays a neuroprotective or damaging role after ischemia. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), one of the largest protein receptor superfamilies in mammals, play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. Statistics show that GPCRs are the targets of about one-fifth of drugs known in the world, predicting potential values as targets for drug research. Studies have demonstrated that nutritional deprivation can directly or indirectly activate GPCRs, mediating a series of downstream biological processes, including autophagy. It can be concluded that there are interactions between autophagy and GPCRs signaling pathway, which provides research evidence for regulating GPCRs-mediated autophagy.

Bilateral microinjection of either the selective D1-receptor (Gs-coupled) agonist Chloro-APB or the selective D2-receptor (Gi-coupled) agonist quinpirole into the NAc partially reversed nerve injury-induced thermal allodynia.

Under neuropathic pain-like condition, specific facilitation of terminals of D1-receptor-expressing NAc neurons projecting to the VTA revealed a feedforward-like antinociceptive circuit. Additionally, functional suppression of cholinergic interneurons that negatively and positively control the activity of D1- and D2-receptor-expressing neurons, respectively, also transiently elicited anti-allodynic effects in nerve injured animals.

Among the DMR-associated genes, Trim2 and Lrpprc showed an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression status. In addition, we observed that mutant Polg1 transgenic mice shared several features of DNA methylation changes in postmortem brains of patients with BD, such as dominant hypomethylation changes in neurons, which include hypomethylation of the molecular motor gene and altered DNA methylation of synapse-related genes in nonneurons.

In this study, we found that an antinociceptive effect on noxious heat after acute exposure to restraint stress was impaired in mice with a conditional knockout of α1A-adrenaline receptors (α1A-ARs) in inhibitory neurons (Vgat-Cre;Adra1aflox/flox mice). A similar reduction was also observed in mice treated with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine, a selective neurotoxin for NAergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC). Furthermore, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings using spinal cord slices revealed that NA-induced increase in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the substantia gelatinosa neurons was suppressed by silodosin, an α1A-AR antagonist, and by conditional knockout of α1A-ARs in inhibitory neurons. Moreover, under unstressed conditions, the antinociceptive effects of intrathecal NA and phenylephrine on noxious heat were lost in Vgat-Cre;Adra1aflox/flox mice.

Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis combined with electrophysiological recordings we identified several amino acids within the Cavβ3 subunit that contribute to the gating of the channel.

In addition, we show that co-expression of SCAMP2 in mammalian cells expressing recombinant Cav3.2 channels caused an almost complete drop of the whole cell T-type current, an effect partly reversed by single amino acid mutations within the conserved cytoplasmic E peptide of SCAMP2. SCAMP2-induced downregulation of T-type currents was also observed in cells expressing Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channel isoforms. Finally, we show that SCAMP2-mediated knockdown of the T-type conductance is caused by the lack of Cav3.2 expression at the cell surface as evidenced by the concomitant loss of intramembrane charge movement without decrease of total Cav3.2 protein level.

Despite their physiological importance, untangling the relationship between DA and NE in the fine control of output function is currently challenging, primarily due to a lack of techniques to allow the observation of spatiotemporal dynamics with sufficiently high selectivity. Although genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors have been developed to detect DA, their poor selectivity prevents distinguishing DA from NE. Here, we report the development of a red fluorescent genetically encoded GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)-activation reporter for DA termed ‘R-GenGAR-DA’. More specifically, a circular permutated red fluorescent protein (cpmApple) was replaced by the third intracellular loop of human DA receptor D1 (DRD1) followed by the screening of mutants within the linkers between DRD1 and cpmApple. We developed two variants: R-GenGAR-DA1.1, which brightened following DA stimulation, and R-GenGAR-DA1.2, which dimmed. R-GenGAR-DA1.2 demonstrated a reasonable dynamic range (ΔF/F0 = − 43%), DA affinity (EC50 = 0.92 µM) and high selectivity for DA over NE (66-fold) in HeLa cells. Taking advantage of the high selectivity of R-GenGAR-DA1.2, we monitored DA in presence of NE using dual-color fluorescence live imaging, combined with the green-NE biosensor GRABNE1m, which has high selectivity for NE over DA (> 350-fold) in HeLa cells and hippocampal neurons grown from primary culture.

Spatial memory, the ability to remember the layout of the external environment and to navigate within its boundaries, is closely related to the autobiographical memory domain. It is served by an overlapping brain circuit, centered around the hippocampus (HPC) where the cognitive map index is stored. Apart from the hippocampus, several cortical structures participate in this process. Their relative contribution is a subject of intense research in both humans and animal models. One of the most widely studied regions is the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), an area in the parietal lobe densely interconnected with the hippocampal formation. Several methodological approaches have been established over decades in order to investigate the cortical aspects of memory. One of the most successful techniques is based on the analysis of brain expression patterns of the immediate early genes (IEGs). The common feature of this diverse group of genes is fast upregulation of their mRNA translation upon physiologically relevant stimulus. In the central nervous system they are rapidly triggered by neuronal activity and plasticity during learning. There is a widely accepted consensus that their expression level corresponds to the engagement of individual neurons in the formation of memory trace. Imaging of the IEGs might therefore provide a picture of an emerging memory engram. In this review we present the overview of IEG mapping studies of retrosplenial cortex in rodent models. We begin with classical techniques, immunohistochemical detection of protein and fluorescent in situ hybridization of mRNA. We then proceed to advanced methods where fluorescent genetically encoded IEG reporters are chronically followed in vivo during memory formation. We end with a combination of genetic IEG labelling and optogenetic approach, where the activity of the entire engram is manipulated.

GABA signaling in SCN is critically involved in this process. Both phasic and tonic modes of GABA signaling exist in SCN. Of the two modes, the tonic mode of GABA signaling has been implicated in light-mediated synchrony of SCN neurons. However, modulatory effects of external light on tonic GABA signalling are yet to be explored. Here, we systematically characterized electrophysiological properties of the clock neurons and determined the spatio-temporal profiles of tonic GABA current. Based on the whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from 76 SCN neurons, the cells with large tonic GABA current (>15 pA) were more frequently found in dorsal SCN. Moreover, tonic GABA current in SCN was highly correlated with the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC), raising a possibility that tonic GABA current is due to spill-over from synaptic release. Interestingly, tonic GABA current was inversely correlated with slice-to-patch time interval, suggesting a critical role of retinal light exposure in intact brain for an induction of tonic GABA current in SCN. To test this possibility, we obtained meticulously prepared retina-attached SCN slices and successfully recorded tonic and phasic GABA signaling in SCN neurons. For the first time, we observed an early-onset, long-lasting tonic GABA current, followed by a slow-onset, short-lasting increase in the phasic GABA frequency, upon direct light-illumination of the attached retina. This result provides the first evidence that external light cue can directly trigger both tonic and phasic GABA signaling in SCN cell.

In dorsal CA1, Cre/ROCK2fl/fl mice displayed significantly increased thin spine density on basal dendrites and reduced mean spine head volume across all spine types on apical dendrites. In ventral CA1, Cre/ROCK2fl/fl mice exhibited significantly increased spine length on apical dendrites. Spine density and morphology were comparable in the mPFC and BLA between both genotypes. These findings suggest that neuronal ROCK2 mediates spine density and morphology in a compartmentalized manner among CA1 pyramidal cells, and that in the absence of ROCK2 these mechanisms may contribute to anxiety-like behaviors.","c(""ROCK2"", ""Rho ki ase"", ""De dritic spi e"", ""Hippocampus"", ""Prefro tal cortex"", ""Amygdala"")","Jeremy H.

Automatic behavior can be guided by past experiences, such as learned values associated with objects. Passive-viewing and free-viewing tasks with no immediate outcomes provide a testable condition in which monkeys and humans automatically retrieve value memories and perform habitual searching. Interestingly, in these tasks, caudal regions of the basal ganglia structures are involved in automatic retrieval of learned object values and habitual gaze. In contrast, rostral regions do not participate in these activities but instead monitor the changes in outcomes. These findings indicate that automatic behaviors based on the value memories are processed selectively by the caudal regions of the primate basal ganglia system.

Beyond the brainstem, it is unclear if RBD patients comorbid with PD have more affected striatal dopamine denervation compared to PD patients unaffected by RBD (PD-RBD−). To elucidate this, we evaluated the availability of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), an index of nigrostriatal dopamine innervation, in 15 PD patients with probable RBD (PD-RBD+), 15 PD-RBD−, and 15 age-matched healthy controls (HC) using [11C]DTBZ PET imaging. This technique measured VMAT2 availability within striatal regions of interest (ROI). A mixed effect model was used to compare the radioligand binding of VMAT2 between the three groups for each striatal ROI, while co-varying for sex, cognitive function and depression scores. Multiple regressions were also computed to predict clinical measures from group condition and VMAT2 binding within all ROIs explored. We observed a significant main effect of group condition on VMAT2 availability within the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamus. Specifically, our results revealed that PD-RBD+ had lower VMAT2 availability compared to HC in all these regions except for the subthalamus and substantia nigra, while PD-RBD− was significantly lower than HC in all these regions. PD-RBD− showed a negative relationship between motor severity and VMAT2 availability within the left caudate. Our findings reflect that both PD patient subgroups had similar denervation within the nigrostriatal pathway. There were no significant interactions detected between radioligand binding and clinical scores in PD-RBD+. Taken together, VMAT2 and striatal dopamine denervation in general may not be a significant contributor to the pathophysiology of RBD in PD patients. Future studies are encouraged to explore other underlying neural chemistry mechanisms contributing to RBD in PD patients.","c(""Parki so ’s disease"", ""REM sleep behaviour disorder"", ""Positro emissio tomography"", ""VMAT2"", ""[11C]DTBZ"")","c(""Mikaeel Valli"", ""Antonio P.

Here, to uncover the specific functions of Olig2-astrocytes, we first analyzed public single-cell RNA-seq databases of adult mouse brains. Unbiased classification of gene expression profiles and subsequent gene ontology analyses revealed that the majority of Olig2-astrocytes belonged to an astrocytic cluster that is enriched for transporter-related genes. SLC7A10 (also known as ASC-1) was one of the representative neutral amino acid transporter genes in the cluster. To complement the in silico data analyses, we differentially isolated Olig2- and GFAP-astrocytes from the same frozen section of the lateral globus pallidus using laser microdissection and compared their gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We confirmed that Olig2 and GFAP mRNAs were preferentially expressed in the Olig2- and GFAP-astrocytes, respectively, indicating that the laser microdissection method yielded minimal cross-contamination between two types of cells. The Olig2-astrocytes expressed significantly higher levels of SLC7A10 mRNA than the GFAP-astrocytes, corroborating the in silico data. We next localized SLC7A10 protein by immunohistochemistry in the lateral globus pallidus, which was also genetically labeled for Olig2. SLC7A10 co-localized with Olig2-genetic labeling, especially on the fine processes of Olig2-astrocytes. These results are consistent with the recent discovery that SLC7A10 is expressed not only in neurons but also in a subset of astrocytes.

However, the regulation and function of KIFs in the prelimbic cortex insofar as mediating memory consolidation is not known.

Different species of songbirds exhibit species-specific learning programs during song acquisition. Songbirds with open-ended vocal learning capacity, such as the canary, modify their songs during adulthood. Nevertheless, the neural molecular mechanisms underlying open-ended vocal learning are not fully understood. We investigated the singing-driven expression of neural activity-dependent genes (Arc, Egr1, c-fos, Nr4a1, Sik1, Dusp6, and Gadd45β) in the canary to examine a potential relationship between the gene expression level and the degree of seasonal vocal plasticity at different ages. The expression of these genes was differently regulated throughout the critical period of vocal learning in the zebra finch, a closed-ended song learner. In the canary, the neural activity-dependent genes were induced by singing in the song nuclei throughout the year. However, in the vocal motor nucleus, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), all genes were regulated with a higher induction rate by singing in the fall than in the spring. The singing-driven expression of these genes showed a similar induction rate in the fall between the first year juvenile and the second year adult canaries, suggesting a seasonal, not age-dependent, regulation of the neural activity-dependent genes. By measuring seasonal vocal plasticity and singing-driven gene expression, we found that in RA, the induction intensity of the neural activity-dependent genes was correlated with the state of vocal plasticity. These results demonstrate a correlation between vocal plasticity and the singing-driven expression of neural activity-dependent genes in RA through song development, regardless of whether a songbird species possesses an open- or closed-ended vocal learning capacity.","c(""So g lear i g"", ""Se sorimotor lear i g"", ""Lear i g plasticity"", ""Critical period"", ""Arc"", ""IEGs"")","Kazuhiro Wada","wada@si.hokudai.a.jp","29 October 2021"

CNS immune status emerges by the integration of the responses of resident and not resident cells, leading to alterations in neural circuits functions. To explore spinal cord astrocyte reactivity to inflammatory threats we focused our study on the effects of local inflammation in a controlled micro-environment, the organotypic spinal slices, developed from the spinal cord of mouse embryos. These organ cultures represent a complex in vitro model where sensory-motor cytoarchitecture, synaptic properties and spinal cord resident cells, are retained in a 3D fashion and we recently exploit these cultures to model two diverse immune conditions in the CNS, involving different inflammatory networks and products. Here, we specifically focus on the tuning of calcium signaling in astrocytes by these diverse types of inflammation and we investigate the mechanisms which modulate intracellular calcium release and its spreading among astrocytes in the inflamed environment. Organotypic spinal cord slices are cultured for two or three weeks in vitro (WIV) and exposed for 6 h to a cocktail of cytokines (CKs), composed by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 β) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). By live calcium imaging of the ventral horn, we document an increase in active astrocytes and in the occurrence of spontaneous calcium oscillations displayed by these cells when exposed to each inflammatory threat. Through several pharmacological treatments, we demonstrate that intracellular calcium sources and the activation of connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels have a pivotal role in increasing calcium intercellular communication in both CKs and LPS conditions, while the Cx43 gap junction communication is apparently reduced by the inflammatory treatments.","c(""Pro-i flammatory cytoki es"", ""LPS"", ""Live imagi g"", ""Neuroi flammatio "", ""Gap ju ctio s"", ""Hemicha els"", ""Spi al euro s"", ""Immu e reside t cells"")","c(""Clara Ballerini"", ""Laura Ballerini"")","""lara.ballerini@unifi.it"", ""laura.ballerini@sissa.it""","25 October 2021"

Here, we evaluated the localization of Nicastrin, a γ-secretase subunit, at nanometer sized functional zones of the synapse. With the help of super resolution microscopy, we confirm that Nicastrin is organized into nanodomains of high molecular density within an excitatory synapse. A similar nanoorganization was also observed for APP and the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, Presenilin 1, that were discretely associated with Nicastrin nanodomains. Though Nicastrin is a functional subunit of γ-secretase, the Nicastrin and Presenilin1 nanodomains were either colocalized or localized independent of each other. The Nicastrin and Presenilin domains highlight a potential independent regulation of these molecules different from their canonical secretase function. The collisions between secretases and substrate molecules decide the probability and rate of product formation for transmembrane proteolysis.

Electrophysiology assessment showed that all COs exhibited mature neuronal firing at 6–10 months old. At this age, we observed significant changes in the electrophysiology of the COs with disease-associated mutations (dCOs) as compared with the HC, including reduced neuronal network communication, slowing neuronal oscillations, and increased coupling of delta and theta phases to the amplitudes of gamma oscillations. Such changes were linked with the detection of hypersynchronous events like spike-and-wave discharges.

Although it has been reported that synapses themselves change from an immature to a mature state as neurons mature, there are few reports that clearly show when and how human stem cell-derived neurons change to mature synaptic structures. This study was designed to elucidate the synapse formation process of hiPSC-neurons. We propagated hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiPSC-NPCs) that expressed localized markers of the ventral hindbrain as neurospheres by dual SMAD inhibition and then differentiated them into hiPSC-neurons in vitro. After 49 days of in vitro differentiation, hiPSC-neurons significantly expressed pre- and postsynaptic markers at both the transcript and protein levels. However, the expression of postsynaptic markers was lower than in normal human or normal rat brain tissues, and immunostaining analysis showed that it was relatively modest and was lower than that of presynaptic markers and that its localization in synaptic structures was insufficient. Neurophysiological analysis using a microelectrode array also revealed that no synaptic activity was generated on hiPSC-neurons at 49 days of differentiation. Analysis of subtype markers by immunostaining revealed that most hiPSC-neurons expressed vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2). The presence or absence of NGF, which is required for the survival of cholinergic neurons, had no effect on their cell fractionation. These results suggest that during the synaptogenesis of hiPSC-neurons, the formation of presynaptic structures is not the only requirement for the formation of postsynaptic structures and that the mRNA expression of postsynaptic markers does not correlate with the formation of their mature structures. Technically, we also confirmed a certain level of robustness and reproducibility of our neuronal differentiation method in a multicenter setting, which will be helpful for future research. Synapse formation with mature postsynaptic structures will remain an interesting issue for stem cell-derived neurons, and the present method can be used to obtain early and stable quality neuronal cultures from hiPSC-NPCs.","c(""Huma -i duced pluripote t stem cell"", ""Neural proge itor cell"", ""Vesicular glutamate tra sporter 2 (VGLUT2)"", ""Drebri "", ""PSD-95"")","Yonehiro Kanemura","kanemura.yonehiro.hk@mail.hosp.go.jp","11 October 2021"

In this study, we provide several lines of molecular and genetic evidences that S100B is expressed in both protoplasmic astrocytes and myelinating oligodendrocytes. In the developing spinal cord, S100B is first expressed in the ventral neuroepithelial cells, and later in ALDH1L1+/GS+ astrocytes in the gray matter.

Consistent with this observation, S100B expression is selectively lost in the white matter in Olig2-null mutants in which oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are not produced, and dramatically reduced in Myrf-conditional knockout mutants in which OPCs fail to differentiate. Similar expression patterns of S100B are observed in the developing forebrain.

Metabolomic screening among functionally related brain areas provides molecular signatures and biomarkers to improve the treatment of psychopathologies. Herein, we analyzed and compared changes of metabolites in the hippocampus, amygdala, and posterior parietal cortex under the fear retrieval condition. Metabolite profiles of posterior parietal cortex and amygdala were similarly changed after fear memory retrieval. While the retrieval of fear memory perturbed various metabolic pathways, most metabolic pathways that overlapped among the three brain regions had high ranks in the enrichment analysis of posterior parietal cortex. In posterior parietal cortex, the most perturbed pathways were pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, purine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and NAD+ dependent signaling. Metabolites of posterior parietal cortex including 4′-phosphopantetheine, xanthine, glutathione, ADP-ribose, ADP-ribose 2′-phosphate, and cyclic ADP-ribose were significantly regulated in these metabolic pathways. These results point to the importance of metabolites of posterior parietal cortex in conditioned fear memory retrieval and may provide potential biomarker candidates for traumatic memory-related mental disorders.","c(""Co ditio ed fear memory"", ""Metabolomics"", ""Posterior parietal cortex"", ""Amygdala"", ""Hippocampus"")","Eun-Kyoung Kim","ekkim@dgist.a.kr","06 October 2021"

Specific single variants (SNVs, formerly single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in the genes encoding N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders by altering glutamate transmission. However, these variants associated with cognition and mental activity have rarely been explored in healthy adolescents. In this study, we screened for SNVs in the glutamatergic signaling pathway to identify genetic variants associated with cognitive ability. We found that SNVs in the subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors, including GRIA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, GRIN3A, GRIN3B, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMK2A) are associated with cognitive function. Plasma CaMK2A level was correlated positively with the cognitive ability of Taiwanese senior high school students. We demonstrated that elevating CaMK2A increased its autophosphorylation at T286 and increased the expression of its downstream targets, including GluA1 and phosphor- GluA1 in vivo. Additionally, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a downstream target of CaMK2A, was found to activate the expression of CaMK2A, suggesting that MeCP2 and CaMK2A can form a positive feedback loop. In summary, two members of the glutamatergic signaling pathway, CaMK2A and MeCP2, are implicated in the cognitive ability of adolescents; thus, altering the expression of CaMK2A may affect cognitive ability in youth.","c(""Glutamatergic sig ali g pathway"", ""Si gle- ucleotide varia t (SNV)"", ""Methyl-CpG bi di g protei 2 (MeCP2)"", ""Calcium/calmoduli -depe de t protei ki ase IIα (CaMK2A)"", ""Cog itive fu ctio "")","c(""Ting-Kuang Yeh"", ""Chun-Yen Chang"")","""Tkyeh@ntnu.edu.tw"", ""hangy@ntnu.edu.tw""","04 October 2021"

At present, ACKR3 is considered a target for cancer and cardiovascular disorders, but less is known about the potential of ACKR3 as a target for brain disease. Further, mouse lines have been created to identify cells expressing the receptor, but there is no tool to visualize and study the receptor itself under physiological conditions. Here, we engineered a knock-in (KI) mouse expressing a functional ACKR3-Venus fusion protein to directly detect the receptor, particularly in the adult brain. In HEK-293 cells, native and fused receptors showed similar membrane expression, ligand induced trafficking and signaling profiles, indicating that the Venus fusion does not alter receptor signaling. We also found that ACKR3-Venus enables direct real-time monitoring of receptor trafficking using resonance energy transfer. In ACKR3-Venus knock-in mice, we found normal ACKR3 mRNA levels in the brain, suggesting intact gene transcription. We fully mapped receptor expression across 14 peripheral organs and 112 brain areas and found that ACKR3 is primarily localized to the vasculature in these tissues. In the periphery, receptor distribution aligns with previous reports. In the brain there is notable ACKR3 expression in endothelial vascular cells, hippocampal GABAergic interneurons and neuroblast neighboring cells. In conclusion, we have generated Ackr3-Venus knock-in mice with a traceable ACKR3 receptor, which will be a useful tool to the research community for interrogations about ACKR3 biology and related diseases.

However, a limited number of studies have examined the effect of hypoxia in combination with inflammation (Hypo-Inf) on neural function. We previously reported that neuronal excitability in hippocampal CA1 neurons decreased during hypoxia and greatly rebounded upon reoxygenation. We attributed this altered excitability mainly to the dynamic regulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels and input resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying input resistance changes by Hypo-Inf and reperfusion remained unclear. In the present study, we found that a change in the density of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IDR) can explain the input resistance variability. Furthermore, voltage-dependent inactivation of A-type potassium (IA) channels shifted in the depolarizing direction during Hypo-Inf and reverted to normal upon reperfusion without a significant alteration in the maximum current density. Our results indicate that changes in the input resistance, and consequently excitability, caused by Hypo-Inf and reperfusion are at least partially regulated by the availability and voltage dependence of KV channels. Moreover, these results suggest that selective KV channel modulators can be used as potential neuroprotective drugs to minimize hypoxia- and reperfusion-induced neuronal damage.","c(""Hypoxia"", ""I flammatio "", ""A-type potassium cha el"", ""Delayed rectifier potassium cha el"", ""I put resista ce"")","c(""Yoon-Sil Yang"", ""Jong-Cheol Rah"")","""yus3462@kbri.re.kr"", ""jrah@kbri.re.kr""","23 September 2021"

Upon GPCR activation, astrocytes can respond with transient variations in intracellular Ca2+. In addition, Ca2+-dependent and/or Ca2+-independent release of gliotransmitters can occur, allowing them to engage in bidirectional neuron-astrocyte communication. The development of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) has facilitated many new discoveries on the roles of astrocytes in both physiological and pathological conditions. They are an excellent tool, as they can target endogenous GPCR-mediated intracellular signal transduction pathways specifically in astrocytes. With increasing interest and accumulating research on this topic, several discrepancies on astrocytic Ca2+ signalling and astrocyte-mediated effects on synaptic plasticity have emerged, preventing a clear-cut consensus about the downstream effects of DREADDs in astrocytes. In the present study, we performed a side-by-side evaluation of the effects of bath application of the DREADD agonist, clozapine-N-oxide (10 µM), on Gq- and Gi-DREADD activation in mouse CA1 hippocampal astrocytes. In doing so, we aimed to avoid confounding factors, such as differences in experimental procedures, and to directly compare the actions of both DREADDs on astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and synaptic plasticity in acute hippocampal slices. We used an adeno-associated viral vector approach to transduce dorsal hippocampi of male, 8-week-old C57BL6/J mice, to drive expression of either the Gq-DREADD or Gi-DREADD in CA1 astrocytes. A viral vector lacking the DREADD construct was used to generate controls. Here, we show that agonism of Gq-DREADDs, but not Gi-DREADDs, induced consistent increases in spontaneous astrocytic Ca2+ events. Moreover, we demonstrate that both Gq-DREADD as well as Gi-DREADD-mediated activation of CA1 astrocytes induces long-lasting synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 Schaffer collateral pathway in the absence of a high frequency stimulus. Moreover, we report for the first time that astrocytic Gi-DREADD activation is sufficient to elicit de novo potentiation.

A missense mutation (D620N) in VPS35 leads to autosomal-dominant, late-onset Parkinson’s disease. Here, we study the basic neurobiology of VPS35 and Parkinson’s disease mutation effects in the D620N knock-in mouse and the effect of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) inhibition on synaptic phenotypes. The study was conducted using a VPS35 D620N knock-in mouse that expresses VPS35 at endogenous levels. Protein levels, phosphorylation states, and binding ratios in brain lysates from knock-in mice and wild-type littermates were assayed by co-immunoprecipitation and western blot. Dendritic protein co-localization, AMPA receptor surface expression, synapse density, and glutamatergic synapse activity in primary cortical cultures from knock-in and wild-type littermates were assayed using immunocytochemistry and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. In brain tissue, we confirm VPS35 forms complexes with LRRK2 and AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluA1 subunits, in addition to NMDA-type glutamate receptor GluN1 subunits and D2-type dopamine receptors. Receptor and LRRK2 binding was unaltered in D620N knock-in mice, but we confirm the mutation results in reduced binding of VPS35 with WASH complex member FAM21, and increases phosphorylation of the LRRK2 kinase substrate Rab10, which is reversed by LRRK2 kinase inhibition in vivo. In cultured cortical neurons from knock-in mice, pRab10 is also increased, and reversed by LRRK2 inhibition. The mutation also results in increased endosomal recycling protein cluster density (VPS35-FAM21 co-clusters and Rab11 clusters), glutamate transmission, and GluA1 surface expression. LRRK2 kinase inhibition, which reversed Rab10 hyper-phosphorylation, did not rescue elevated glutamate release or surface GluA1 expression in knock-in neurons, but did alter AMPAR traffic in wild-type cells. The results improve our understanding of the cell biology of VPS35, and the consequences of the D620N mutation in developing neuronal networks. Together the data support a chronic synaptopathy model for latent neurodegeneration, providing phenotypes and candidate pathophysiological stresses that may drive eventual transition to late-stage parkinsonism in VPS35 PD. The study demonstrates the VPS35 mutation has effects that are independent of ongoing LRRK2 kinase activity, and that LRRK2 kinase inhibition alters basal physiology of glutamate synapses in vitro.","c(""Parki so 's disease"", ""Alpha-ami o-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropio ic acid (AMPA)"", ""NMDA"", ""Dopami e Receptor"", ""Glutamate"", ""Sy apses"", ""Sy aptic tra smissio "", ""K ock-i mouse"", ""Retromer"", ""Protei traffic"")","Austen J.

The expression and role of AVP exhibit remarkable divergence between these two neuronal populations. Polysynaptic pathways enable these neuronal groups to regulate each other. AVP neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus increase the production of adrenal stress hormones by stimulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Outside the hypothalamus, the medial amygdala also contains robust amounts of AVP. Contrary to the hypothalamic counterpart, the expression of extra-hypothalamic medial amygdala AVP is sexually dimorphic, in that it is preferentially transcribed in males in response to the continual presence of testosterone. Male gonadal hormones typically generate a negative feedback on the neuroendocrine stress axis. Here, we investigated whether testosterone-responsive medial amygdala AVP neurons provide negative feedback to hypothalamic AVP, thereby providing a feedback loop to suppress stress endocrine response during periods of high testosterone secretion. Contrary to our expectation, we found that AVP overexpression within the posterodorsal medial amygdala increased the recruitment of hypothalamic AVP neurons during stress, without affecting the total number of AVP neurons or the number of recently activated neurons following stress.

Here, we show that the phosphorylation status of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) rapidly changes in response to synaptic and neural activities. Intraperitoneal injections of the GABA A receptor (GABAAR) antagonist picrotoxin and the glycine receptor antagonist brucine rapidly dephosphorylated eEF2. Conversely, potentiation of GABAARs or inhibition of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) induced rapid phosphorylation of eEF2 in both the hippocampus and forebrain of mice. Chemogenetic suppression of hippocampal principal neuron activity promoted eEF2 phosphorylation. Novel context exploration and acute restraint stress rapidly modified the phosphorylation status of hippocampal eEF2. Furthermore, the hippocampal eEF2 phosphorylation levels under basal conditions were reduced in mice exhibiting epilepsy and abnormally enhanced excitability in CA3 pyramidal neurons.

In this paper, we aimed to study how the GABAergic system participates in regulating the excitability of ACC PNs, consequently affecting chronic inflammatory pain-related anxiety. A rat model of CFA-induced chronic inflammatory pain displayed anxiety-like behaviors, increased the excitability of ACC PNs, and reduced inhibitory presynaptic transmission; however, the number of GAD65/67 was not altered.

However, as there is no physical interaction between them, the underlying mechanism for their coacervation remains unknown. Here, we showed that the coacervation between Syph and Syn is primarily governed by multivalent pi–cation electrostatic interactions among tyrosine residues of Syph C-terminal (Ct) and positively charged Syn. We found that Syph Ct is intrinsically disordered and it alone can form liquid droplets by interactions among themselves at high concentration in a crowding environment in vitro or when assisted by additional interactions by tagging with light-sensitive CRY2PHR or subunits of a multimeric protein in living cells. Syph Ct contains 10 repeated sequences, 9 of them start with tyrosine, and mutating 9 tyrosine to serine (9YS) completely abolished the phase separating property of Syph Ct, indicating tyrosine-mediated pi-interactions are critical. We further found that 9YS mutation failed to coacervate with Syn, and since 9YS retains Syph’s negative charge, the results indicate that pi–cation interactions rather than simple charge interactions are responsible for their coacervation.

Here we sought to identify PAG subregions and cell types which instruct memory formation in response to aversive events. We found that optogenetic inhibition of neurons in the dorsolateral subregion of the PAG (dlPAG), but not the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG), during an aversive event reduced memory formation. Furthermore, inhibition of a specific population of thalamus projecting dlPAG neurons projecting to the anterior paraventricular thalamus (aPVT) reduced aversive learning, but had no effect on the expression of previously learned defensive behaviors. By contrast, inactivation of dlPAG neurons which project to the posterior PVT (pPVT) or centromedial intralaminar thalamic nucleus (CM) had no effect on learning.

However, when recombinant GDF11 (rGDF11) is administered systemically in aged mice, it promotes neurogenesis, the opposite of its role during development. The goal of the present study was to reconcile this apparent discrepancy by performing the first detailed investigation into the expression of endogenous GDF11 in the adult brain and its effects on neurogenesis. Using quantitative histological analysis, we observed that Gdf11 is most highly expressed in adult neurogenic niches and non-neurogenic regions within the hippocampus, choroid plexus, thalamus, habenula, and cerebellum. To investigate the role of endogenous GDF11 during adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we generated a tamoxifen inducible mouse that allowed us to reduce GDF11 levels. Depletion of Gdf11 during adulthood increased proliferation of neural progenitors and decreased the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus, suggesting that endogenous GDF11 remains a negative regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice. These findings further support the idea that circulating systemic GDF11 and endogenously expressed GDF11 in the adult brain have different target cells or mechanisms of action. Our data describe a role for GDF11-dependent signaling in adult neurogenesis that has implications for how GDF11 may be used to treat CNS disease.","c(""GDF11"", ""Adult hippocampal euroge esis"", ""Neural proge itor cells"", ""Proliferatio "", ""K ockout mouse"")","Lee L.

The protective effects of C8 and C10 have been proposed to be driven by hepatic production of ketone bodies. However, plasma ketone levels correlates poorly with the cerebral effects of C8 and C10, suggesting that additional mechanism are in place. Here we investigated cellular C8 and C10 metabolism in the brain and explored how the protective effects of C8 and C10 may be linked to cellular metabolism. Using dynamic isotope labeling, with [U-13C]C8 and [U-13C]C10 as metabolic substrates, we show that both C8 and C10 are oxidatively metabolized in mouse brain slices. The 13C enrichment from metabolism of [U-13C]C8 and [U-13C]C10 was particularly prominent in glutamine, suggesting that C8 and C10 metabolism primarily occurs in astrocytes. This finding was corroborated in cultured astrocytes in which C8 increased the respiration linked to ATP production, whereas C10 elevated the mitochondrial proton leak. When C8 and C10 were provided together as metabolic substrates in brain slices, metabolism of C10 was predominant over that of C8. Furthermore, metabolism of both [U-13C]C8 and [U-13C]C10 was unaffected by etomoxir indicating that it is independent of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1). Finally, we show that inhibition of glutamine synthesis selectively reduced 13C accumulation in GABA from [U-13C]C8 and [U-13C]C10 metabolism in brain slices, demonstrating that the glutamine generated from astrocyte C8 and C10 metabolism is utilized for neuronal GABA synthesis.

Excitatory synapses onto SOM-INs show a Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) mediated by type 1a metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1a) that is implicated in hippocampus-dependent learning. The neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) is also critical for hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity, as well as learning and memory. SST effects on hippocampal PCs are well documented, but its actions on inhibitory interneurons remain largely undetermined. In the present work, we investigate the involvement of SST in long-term potentiation of CA1 SOM-IN excitatory synapses using pharmacological approaches targeting the somatostatinergic system and whole cell recordings in slices from transgenic mice expressing eYFP in SOM-INs. We report that application of exogenous SST14 induces long-term potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in SOM-INs via somatostatin type 1–5 receptors (SST1-5Rs) but does not affect synapses of PC or parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Hebbian LTP in SOM-INs was prevented by inhibition of SSTRs and by depletion of SST by cysteamine treatment, suggesting a critical role of endogenous SST in LTP. LTP of SOM-IN excitatory synapses induced by SST14 was independent of NMDAR and mGluR1a, activity-dependent, and prevented by blocking GABAA receptor function. Our results indicate that endogenous SST may contribute to Hebbian LTP at excitatory synapses of SOM-INs by controlling GABAA inhibition, uncovering a novel role for SST in regulating long-term synaptic plasticity in somatostatinergic cells that may be important for hippocampus-dependent memory processes.","c(""GABA i ter euro s"", ""Somatotropi -release i hibitory factor—SRIF"", ""Whole cell recordi gs"", ""Cysteami e"", ""SST1-5 receptors"", ""Disi hibitio "", ""GABAA i hibitio "", ""Hebbia LTP"")","Jean-Claude Lacaille","jean-laude.laaille@umontreal.a","24 August 2021"

The expression of PSD95, a vital synaptic scaffolding molecule, is down-regulated by hypobaric hypoxia exposure and post-transcriptionally regulated by cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (Cirbp) through 3′-UTR region binding. PSD95 expressing alleviates hypoxia-induced dendritic spine morphology changes of hippocampal neurons and memory deterioration.

The hippocampus is vulnerable to acute sleep deprivation with changes in gene expression, cell signaling, and protein synthesis. Sleep deprivation also has long lasting effects on memory and performance that persist after recovery sleep, as seen in behavioral studies from invertebrates to humans. Although previous research has shown that acute sleep deprivation impacts gene expression, the extent to which sleep deprivation affects gene regulation remains unknown. Using an unbiased deep RNA sequencing approach, we investigated the effects of acute sleep deprivation on gene expression in the hippocampus. We identified 1,146 genes that were significantly dysregulated following sleep deprivation with 507 genes upregulated and 639 genes downregulated, including protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs not previously identified as impacted by sleep deprivation. Notably, genes significantly upregulated after sleep deprivation were associated with RNA splicing and the nucleus. In contrast, downregulated genes were associated with cell adhesion, dendritic localization, the synapse, and postsynaptic membrane. Furthermore, we found through independent experiments analyzing a subset of genes that three hours of recovery sleep following acute sleep deprivation was sufficient to normalize mRNA abundance for most genes, although exceptions occurred for some genes that may affect RNA splicing or transcription.

We previously identified a short peptide aptamer from collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), designated the Ca2+ channel-binding domain 3 (CBD3) peptide, that conferred protection against excitotoxicity and traumatic brain injury. ST2-104, a nona-arginine (R9)-fused CBD3 peptide, exerted beneficial effects on neuropathic pain and was neuroprotective in a model of Alzheimer’s disease; however, the effect of ST2-104 on cerebral ischemia and its mechanism of action have not been studied.

ST2-104 reduced the infarct volume and improved the neurological score of rats subjected to MCAO. ST2-104 protected SH-SY5Y cells from death following glutamate exposure via blunting apoptosis and autophagy as well as limiting excessive calcium entry. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), an inhibitor of autophagy, promoted the effects of ST2-104 in inhibiting apoptosis triggered by glutamate while rapamycin, an activator of autophagy, failed to do so. ST2-104 peptide reversed glutamate-induced apoptosis via inhibiting Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ)-mediated autophagy, which was partly enhanced by STO-609 (an inhibitor of CaMKKβ). ST2-104 attenuated neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy through CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR pathway. Our results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of ST2-104 are due to actions on the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy via the CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.

Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inhibition contributes to the overall activity of the PFC. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the excitation-inhibition imbalance of PV+ neurons in the PFC is unknown. Efnb2 is a membrane-bound molecule that plays an important role in the nervous system through binding the Eph receptor. To investigate whether the loss of Efnb2 in PV+ affects anxiety, we examined the behavior of wild type and Efnb2 in PV+ neurons knockout (KO) mice. We monitored the defensive responses to aversive stimuli of elevated plus maze (EPM) and found that KO mice exhibited obvious fearless and anxiolytic behaviors. To further investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism, we performed RNA sequencing, analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and constructed the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The WGCNA identified 12 characteristic modules. Among them, the MEgreen module showed the most significant correlation with KO mice of EPM stimuli. The Gene Ontology enrichment and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that this was related to the distal axon, Ras signaling pathway and insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, the whole-cell voltage clamp recordings also proved that Efnb2 gene knock-out could affect synaptic function. Together with the transcriptomic analysis of mice with Efnb2 knockout on PV+ neurons, our findings suggest that Efnb2 gene in the PV+ neuron of PFC may be a crucial factor for fear and anxiety, which provide an insight into anxiety pathophysiology.","c(""Ef b2"", ""A xiety"", ""RNA-seq"", ""WGCNA"")","c(""Jinghong Chen"", ""Peijun Ju"")","""henjh_008@hotmail.om"", ""jupeijunpp@163.om""","19 July 2021"

Here, we subsequently demonstrated that meningitic E. coli infection could subvert this intercellular communication within BBB by attenuating TGFBRII/Gli2-mediated such signaling. By high-throughput screening, we identified E. coli α-hemolysin as the critical determinant responsible for this attenuation through Sp1-dependent TGFBRII reduction and triggering Ca2+ influx and protein kinase A activation, thus leading to Gli2 suppression.

We first investigated the levels of Bmal1 and other clock proteins in the hippocampus of subjects with epilepsy to define the function of Bmal1. The levels of Bmal1 were decreased during the latent and chronic phases in the experimental group compared with those in the control group. Knockout of Bmal1 in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurons of Bmal1flox/flox mice by Synapsin 1 (Syn1) promoter AAV (adeno-associated virus) lowered the threshold of seizures induced by pilocarpine administration. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed that PCDH19 (protocadherin 19), a gene associated with epilepsy, was regulated by Bmal1.

Furthermore, the higher levels of Bmal1 and PCDH19 were detected in patients with no hippocampal sclerosis (no HS) than in patients with HS International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) type I and III.

A key regulator of this process is mTORC1, a complex comprising the mTOR kinase. Growth factors activate mTORC1 via a pathway involving PI3-kinase, Akt, the TSC complex and the GTPase Rheb. In non-neuronal cells, translocation of mTORC1 to late endocytic compartments (LEs), where Rheb is enriched, is triggered by amino acids. However, the regulation of mTORC1 in neurons remains unclear. In mouse hippocampal neurons, we observed that BDNF and treatments activating NMDA receptors trigger a robust increase in mTORC1 activity. NMDA receptors activation induced a significant recruitment of mTOR onto lysosomes even in the absence of external amino acids, whereas mTORC1 was evenly distributed in neurons under resting conditions. NMDA receptor-induced mTOR translocation to LEs was partly dependent on the BDNF receptor TrkB, suggesting that BDNF contributes to the effect of NMDA receptors on mTORC1 translocation. In addition, the combination of Rheb overexpression and artificial mTORC1 targeting to LEs by means of a modified component of mTORC1 fused with a LE-targeting motif strongly activated mTOR. To gain spatial and temporal control over mTOR localization, we designed an optogenetic module based on light-sensitive dimerizers able to recruit mTOR on LEs. In cells expressing this optogenetic tool, mTOR was translocated to LEs upon photoactivation. In the absence of growth factor, this was not sufficient to activate mTORC1. In contrast, mTORC1 was potently activated by a combination of BDNF and photoactivation. The data demonstrate that two important triggers of synaptic plasticity, BDNF and NMDA receptors, synergistically power the two arms of the mTORC1 activation mechanism, i.e., mTORC1 translocation to LEs and Rheb activation. Moreover, they unmask a functional link between NMDA receptors and mTORC1 that could underlie the changes in the synaptic proteome associated with long-lasting changes in synaptic strength.","c(""mTOR"", ""E do-lysosomes"", ""NMDA receptors"", ""BDNF"", ""Sy aptic plasticity"", ""Optoge etics"")","c(""Damien Carrel"", ""Claire Desnos"")","""damien.arrel@u-paris.fr"", ""laire.desnos@u-paris.fr""","12 July 2021"

However, changes in astrocyte–neuron interactions in reactive or resting-state astrocytes during memory induction remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the time-dependent changes in astrocyte morphology and the number of astrocyte–neuron interactions in the hippocampus over the course of long-term memory formation in 5XFAD mice. Hippocampal-dependent long-term memory was induced using a contextual fear conditioning test in 5XFAD mice. The number of astrocytic processes increased in both wild-type and 5XFAD mice during memory formation. To assess astrocyte–neuron interactions in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, we counted the colocalization of glial fibrillary acidic protein and postsynaptic density protein 95 via immunofluorescence. Both groups revealed an increase in astrocyte–neuron interactions after memory induction. At 24 h after memory formation, the number of tripartite synapses returned to baseline levels in both groups. However, the total number of astrocyte–neuron interactions was significantly decreased in 5XFAD mice. Administration of Stattic, a STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor, rescued the number of astrocyte–neuron interactions in 5XFAD mice.

The APOE4 genotype has been shown to negatively impact vascular amyloid clearance, however, its direct influence on the molecular integrity of the cerebrovasculature compared to other APOE variants (APOE2 and APOE3) has been largely unexplored. To address this, we employed a 10-plex tandem isobaric mass tag approach in combination with an ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography MS/MS (Q-Exactive) method, to interrogate unbiased proteomic changes in cerebrovessels from AD and healthy control brains with different APOE genotypes. We first interrogated changes between healthy control cases to identify underlying genotype specific effects in cerebrovessels. EIF2 signaling, regulation of eIF4 and 70S6K signaling and mTOR signaling were the top significantly altered pathways in E4/E4 compared to E3/E3 cases. Oxidative phosphorylation, EIF2 signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction were the top significant pathways in E2E2 vs E3/E3cases. We also identified AD-dependent changes and their interactions with APOE genotype and found the highest number of significant proteins from this interaction was observed in the E3/E4 (192) and E4/E4 (189) cases. As above, EIF2, mTOR signaling and eIF4 and 70S6K signaling were the top three significantly altered pathways in E4 allele carriers (i.e. E3/E4 and E4/E4 genotypes). Of all the cerebrovascular cell-type specific markers identified in our proteomic analyses, endothelial cell, astrocyte, and smooth muscle cell specific protein markers were significantly altered in E3/E4 cases, while endothelial cells and astrocyte specific protein markers were altered in E4/E4 cases. These proteomic changes provide novel insights into the longstanding link between APOE4 and cerebrovascular dysfunction, implicating a role for impaired autophagy, ER stress, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. These APOE4 dependent changes we identified could provide novel cerebrovascular targets for developing disease modifying strategies to mitigate the effects of APOE4 genotype on AD pathogenesis.","c(""Cerebrovasculature"", ""APOE"", ""Agi g"", ""Alzheimer’s disease"", ""Mural cells"", ""E dothelial cells"", ""Proteomics"", ""Mass spectrometry"")","Joseph O.

Immediate early genes (IEGs) are widely used as a marker for neuronal plasticity. Here, we model the dynamics of IEG expression as a consecutive, irreversible first-order reaction with a limiting substrate. First, we develop an analytical framework to show that such a model, together with two-photon in vivo imaging of IEG expression, can be used to identify distinct neuronal subsets representing multiple memories. Using the above combination, we show that the expression kinetics, rather than intensity threshold, can be used to identify neuronal ensembles responding to the presentation of two events in vivo.

Further, mitochondria are differentially regulated by cocaine in dopamine receptor-1 containing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) vs dopamine receptor-2 (D2)-MSNs. However, there is little understanding into cocaine-induced transcriptional mechanisms and their role in regulating mitochondrial processes. Here, we demonstrate that cocaine enhances binding of the transcription factor, early growth response factor 3 (Egr3), to nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial function and dynamics. Moreover, cocaine exposure regulates mRNA of these mitochondria-associated nuclear genes in both contingent or noncontingent cocaine administration and in both rodent models and human postmortem tissue. Interestingly, several mitochondrial nuclear genes showed distinct profiles of expression in D1-MSNs vs D2-MSNs, with cocaine exposure generally increasing mitochondrial-associated nuclear gene expression in D1-MSNs vs suppression in D2-MSNs. Further, blunting Egr3 expression in D1-MSNs blocks cocaine-enhancement of the mitochondrial-associated transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC1α), and the mitochondrial fission molecule, dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1). Finally, reduction of D1-MSN Egr3 expression attenuates cocaine-induced enhancement of small-sized mitochondria, causally demonstrating that Egr3 regulates mitochondrial morphological adaptations.

In this study, we investigated whether the loss of Epac2, involved in the mTOR-independent pathway, affects autophagy activity and whether the activity of autophagy is associated with social–behavioral phenotypes in mice with Epac2 deficiencies. We observed an accumulation of autophagosomes and a significant increase in autophagic flux in Epac2-deficient neurons, which had no effect on mTOR activity. Next, we examined whether an increase in autophagic activity contributed to the social behavior exhibited in Epac2−/− mice. The social recognition deficit observed in Epac2−/− mice recovered in double transgenic Epac2−/−: Atg5+/− mice.

However, it is unknown how well they capture age-associated processes, particularly given that pluripotent cells are only present during the earliest stages of mammalian development. Epigenetic clocks utilize coordinated age-associated changes in DNA methylation to make predictions that correlate strongly with chronological age. It has been shown that the induction of pluripotency rejuvenates predicted epigenetic age. As existing clocks are not optimized for the study of brain development, we developed the fetal brain clock (FBC), a bespoke epigenetic clock trained in human prenatal brain samples in order to investigate more precisely the epigenetic age of iPSCs and iPSC-neurons. The FBC was tested in two independent validation cohorts across a total of 194 samples, confirming that the FBC outperforms other established epigenetic clocks in fetal brain cohorts. We applied the FBC to DNA methylation data from iPSCs and embryonic stem cells and their derived neuronal precursor cells and neurons, finding that these cell types are epigenetically characterized as having an early fetal age. Furthermore, while differentiation from iPSCs to neurons significantly increases epigenetic age, iPSC-neurons are still predicted as being fetal.

Recent studies demonstrate that increasing neurogenesis after memory formation induces forgetting of previously acquired memories. Neurogenesis-induced forgetting was originally demonstrated in mice, but a recent report suggests that the same effect may be absent in rats. Although a general species difference is possible, other potential explanations for these incongruent findings are that memories which are more strongly reinforced become resilient to forgetting or that perhaps only certain types of memories are affected. Here, we investigated whether neurogenesis-induced forgetting occurs in rats using several hippocampus-dependent tasks including contextual fear conditioning (CFC), the Morris Water Task (MWT), and touchscreen paired associates learning (PAL). Neurogenesis was increased following training using voluntary exercise for 4 weeks before recall of the previous memory was assessed. We show that voluntary running causes forgetting of context fear memories in a neurogenesis-dependent manner, and that neurogenesis-induced forgetting is present in rats across behavioral tasks despite differences in complexity or reliance on spatial, context, or object memories. In addition, we asked whether stronger memories are less susceptible to forgetting by varying the strength of training. Even with a very strong training protocol in the CFC task, we still observed enhanced forgetting related to increased neurogenesis.

While reduced midbrain GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission may contribute to the hyperdopaminergia thought to underpin psychosis in schizophrenia, molecular changes consistent with this have not been reported. We hypothesised that reduced GABA-related molecular markers would be found in the midbrain of people with schizophrenia and that these would correlate with dopaminergic molecular changes. We hypothesised that downregulation of inhibitory neuron markers would be exacerbated in schizophrenia cases with high levels of neuroinflammation. Eight GABAergic-related transcripts were measured with quantitative PCR, and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65/67 and GABAA alpha 3 (α3) (GABRA3) protein were measured with immunoblotting, in post-mortem midbrain (28/28 and 28/26 control/schizophrenia cases for mRNA and protein, respectively), and analysed by both diagnosis and inflammatory subgroups (as previously defined by higher levels of four pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts). We found reductions (21 – 44%) in mRNA encoding both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), GAD1, and parvalbumin (PV) mRNAs and four alpha subunits (α1, α2, α3, α5) of the GABAA receptor in people with schizophrenia compared to controls (p < 0.05). Gene expression of somatostatin (SST) was unchanged (p = 0.485). We confirmed the reduction in GAD at the protein level (34%, p < 0.05). When stratifying by inflammation, only GABRA3 mRNA exhibited more pronounced changes in high compared to low inflammatory subgroups in schizophrenia. GABRA3 protein was expressed by 98% of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and was 23% lower in schizophrenia, though this did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). Expression of transcripts for GABAA receptor alpha subunits 2 and 3 (GABRA2, GABRA3) were positively correlated with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) transcripts in schizophrenia cases (GABRA2; r > 0.630, GABRA3; r > 0.762, all p < 0.001) but not controls (GABRA2; r < − 0.200, GABRA3; r < 0.310, all p > 0.05).

The present paper summarizes methodological issues and experiences gained from studies on the distribution of synaptic and other neuron-specific proteins in cell cultures and brain tissues via a pre-embedding method. An optimal protocol includes careful determination of a fixation condition for any particular antibody, a well-planned tissue processing procedure, and a strict evaluation of the credibility of the labeling. Here, tips and caveats on different steps of the sample preparation protocol are illustrated with examples. A good starting condition for EM-compatible fixation and permeabilization is 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by 30 min incubation with 0.1% saponin. An optimal condition can then be readjusted for each particular antibody. Each lot of the secondary antibody (conjugated with a 1.4 nm small gold particle) needs to be evaluated against known standards for labeling efficiency. Silver enhancement is required to make the small gold visible, and quality of the silver-enhanced signals can be affected by subsequent steps of osmium tetroxide treatment, uranyl acetate en bloc staining, and by detergent or ethanol used to clean the diamond knife for cutting thin sections. Most importantly, verification of signals requires understanding of the protein of interest in order to validate for correct localization of antibodies at expected epitopes on particular organelles, and quantification of signals needs to take into consideration the penetration gradient of reagents and clumping of secondary antibodies.","c(""Sy aptic protei s"", ""Electro microscopy"", ""Immu ogold labeli g"")","Jung-Hwa Tao-Cheng","hengs@ninds.nih.gov","03 June 2021"

Presenilin (PS) is highly expressed in the hippocampus, which is particularly vulnerable in AD. Previous studies of PS function in the hippocampus, however, focused exclusively on excitatory neurons. Whether PS regulates inhibitory neuronal function remained unknown. In the current study, we investigate PS function in GABAergic neurons by performing whole-cell and field-potential electrophysiological recordings using acute hippocampal slices from inhibitory neuron-specific PS conditional double knockout (IN-PS cDKO) mice at 2 months of age, before the onset of age-dependent loss of interneurons. We found that the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) is reduced in hippocampal CA1 neurons of IN-PS cDKO mice, whereas the amplitude of sIPSCs is normal. Moreover, the efficacy of inhibitory neurotransmission as assessed with synaptic input/output relations for evoked mono- and di-synaptic IPSCs is markedly lowered in hippocampal CA1 neurons of IN-PS cDKO mice. Consistent with these findings, IN-PS cDKO mice display enhanced paired-pulse facilitation, frequency facilitation and long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. Interestingly, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by inhibition of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase results in a reduction of IPSC amplitude in control hippocampal neurons but not in IN-PS cDKO neurons, suggesting that impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis in the absence of PS may contribute to the deficiencies in inhibitory neurotransmission. Furthermore, the amplitude of IPSCs induced by short trains of presynaptic stimulation and paired-pulse ratio are decreased in IN-PS cDKO mice.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of hearing loss remain unclear. Cdk5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1 (CDK5RAP1) enables efficient intramitochondrial translation by catalyzing the deposition of 2-methylthio modifications on mitochondrial tRNAs. Here we investigated the effect of defective mitochondrial protein translation on hearing and AHL in a Cdk5rap1 deficiency C57BL/6 mouse model. Compared to control C57BL/6 mice, Cdk5rap1-knockout female mice displayed hearing loss phenotypically similar to AHL from an early age. The premature hearing loss in Cdk5rap1-knockout mice was associated with the degeneration of the spiral ligament and reduction of endocochlear potentials following the loss of auditory sensory cells. Furthermore, cultured primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed early onset of cellular senescence associated with high oxidative stress and cell death. These results indicate that the CDK5RAP1 deficiency-induced defective mitochondrial translation might cause early hearing loss through the induction of cellular senescence and cochlear dysfunction in the inner ear. Our results suggest that the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria might promote AHL progression. Furthermore, our findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated mitochondrial tRNA modifications mechanistically cause AHL. Understanding the mechanisms underlying AHL will guide future clinical investigations and interventions in the attempt to mitigate the consequences of AHL.","c(""Auditory brai stem respo ses"", ""Cdk5rap1"", ""E docochlear pote tials"", ""Heari g loss"", ""Mitocho drial tRNA"", ""Spiral ligame t of cochlea"")","Toru Miwa","t-miwa@kitano-hp.or.jp","17 May 2021"

Here, we tested the effects of genetic variants of the 5‐HT1A receptor (CC/G-carriers) and 5-HTT (high/intermediate/low expression) on mood, pain sensitivity, cerebral processing of evoked pain (functional MRI) and concentrations of GABA and glutamate (MR spectroscopy) in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and thalamus in FMS and healthy controls (HC).

We investigated these mechanisms by focusing on the role of descending noradrenergic (NAergic) signaling because our recent study revealed the essential role of the astrocytic Ca2+ responses evoked by intraplantar capsaicin. Using in vivo SDH imaging, we found that the Ca2+ level increase in SDH astrocytes induced by intraplantar formalin injection was suppressed by ablation of SDH-projecting locus coeruleus (LC)-NAergic neurons. Furthermore, the formalin-induced Ca2+ response was dramatically decreased by the loss of α1A-adrenaline receptors (ARs) in astrocytes located in the superficial laminae of the SDH. Moreover, similar inhibition was observed in mice pretreated intrathecally with an α1A-AR-specific antagonist.

Manipulating acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in the amygdala via carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation enhances memory retrieval and its lability within the reconsolidation window. Moreover, pairing CO2 inhalation with retrieval bears the reactivation of the memory trace and enhances the synaptic exchange of the calcium-impermeable AMPA receptors to calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. Our patch-clamp data suggest that the exchange of the AMPA receptors depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), via protein degradation. Ziram (50 µM), a ubiquitination inhibitor, reduces the turnover of the AMPA receptors. CO2 inhalation with retrieval boosts the ubiquitination without altering the proteasome activity. Several calcium-dependent kinases potentially involved in the CO2-inhalation regulated memory liability were identified using the Kinome assay.

We were surprised to find that expression of all NMDA receptor subunits was greatly enhanced in mGlu5−/− mice at PND21. In contrast, at PND9, expression of the GluN2B subunit was enhanced, whereas expression of GluN2A and GluN2D subunits was reduced in both regions. These modifications were transient and disappeared in the adult life (PND75). Changes in the transcripts of interneuron-related genes (encoding parvalbumin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, reelin, and the two isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase) were also observed in mGlu5−/− mice across postnatal development. For example, the transcript encoding parvalbumin was up-regulated in the prefrontal cortex of mGlu5−/− mice at PND9 and PND21, whereas it was significantly reduced at PND75. These findings suggest that in mGlu5−/− mice a transient overexpression of NMDA receptor subunits may compensate for the lack of the NMDA receptor partner, mGlu5. Interestingly, in mGlu5−/− mice the behavioral response to the NMDA channel blocker, MK-801, was significantly increased at PND21, and largely reduced at PND75.

This chromosomal deletion is known as high genetic risk factors for various psychiatric disorders. The different deletion types are identified in 22q11.2DS patients, including the most common 3.0-Mb deletion, and the less-frequent 1.5-Mb and 1.4-Mb deletions. In previous animal studies of psychiatric disorders associated with 22q11.2DS mainly focused on the 1.5-Mb deletion and model mice mimicking the human 1.5-Mb deletion have been established with diverse genetic backgrounds, which resulted in the contradictory phenotypes. On the other hand, the contribution of the genes in 1.4-Mb region to psychiatric disorders is poorly understood. In this study, we generated two mouse lines that reproduced the 1.4-Mb and 1.5-Mb deletions of 22q11.2DS [Del(1.4 Mb)/+ and Del(1.5 Mb)/+] on the pure C57BL/6N genetic background.

Furthermore, apparently intact social recognition in Del(1.4 Mb)/+ and Del(1.5 Mb)/+ mice suggests that the impaired social recognition observed in Del(3.0 Mb)/+ mice mimicking the human 3.0-Mb deletion requires mutations both in 1.4-Mb and 1.5 Mb regions.

Previously, we found that calretinin is dynamically expressed in layer 5a. In this study, we analyzed calretinin KO mice and found that the dendritic complexity and length of layer 5a pyramidal neurons were significantly decreased after calretinin ablation. The membrane excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission of layer 5a neurons were increased. Consequently, the organization of the barrels was impaired. Moreover, layer 4 spiny stellate cells were not able to properly gather, leading to abnormal formation of barrel walls as the ratio of barrel/septum size obviously decreased. Calretinin KO mice exhibited deficits in exploratory and whisker-associated tactile behaviors as well as social novelty preference.

In vitro (cultured neurons) and in vivo, an antibody specific to phosphorylated T172 (pT172 antibody) specifically recognized cultured growth cones and growing axons in developing mouse neurons, respectively. Immunoblotting showed that pT172 antigens were more rapidly downregulated throughout development than those of pS96 antibody.

Herein, we show that ER-phagy (ER-targeted selective autophagy) is required for progress of ER stress and that palmitate decreases ER stress by inhibiting ER-phagy in hypothalamic cells under starvation. Palmitate inhibited starvation-induced ER-phagy by increasing the level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein, which inhibits autophagy initiation.

Although a certain degree of heterogeneity among GCs has been recently reported, variability of GC responses to MF inputs has never been associated with their most notable structural variability, location of their projecting PFs in the ML. Here, we utilize an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated labeling technique that enables us to categorize GCs according to the location of their PFs, and compare the Ca2+ responses to MF stimulations between three groups of GCs, consisting of either GCs having PFs at the deep (D-GCs), middle (M-GCs), or superficial (S-GCs) sublayer. Our structural analysis revealed that there was no correlation between position of GC soma in the GC layer and location of its PF in the ML, confirming that our AAV-mediated labeling was important to test the projection-dependent variability of the Ca2+ responses in GCs. We then found that the Ca2+ responses of D-GCs differed from those of M-GCs. Pharmacological experiments implied that the different Ca2+ responses were mainly attributable to varied distributions of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) at the synaptic and extrasynaptic regions of GC dendrites. In addition to GABAAR distributions, amounts of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors appear to be also varied, because Ca2+ responses were different between D-GCs and M-GCs when glutamate spillover was enhanced. Whereas the Ca2+ responses of S-GCs were mostly equivalent to those of D-GCs and M-GCs, the blockade of GABA uptake resulted in larger Ca2+ responses in S-GCs compared with D-GCs and M-GCs, implying existence of mechanisms leading to more excitability in S-GCs with increased GABA release. Thus, this study reveals MF stimulation-mediated non-uniform Ca2+ responses in the cerebellar GCs associated with the location of their PFs in the ML, and raises a possibility that combination of inherent functional variability of GCs and their specific axonal projection contributes to the information processing through the GCs.","c(""Cerebellar gra ule cells"", ""Calcium imagi g"", ""AAV-drive labeli g"", ""Heteroge eity"", ""Receptor distributio s"")","c(""Taegon Kim"", ""Yukio Yamamoto"", ""Keiko Tanaka-Yamamoto"")","""taegon.kim@kist.re.kr"", ""yukio.kist@gmail.om"", ""keikoyamat@gmail.om""","31 March 2021"

Most AD researches have focused on neurodegeneration mechanisms. Considering that neurodegenerative changes are not reversible, understanding early functional changes before neurodegeneration is critical to develop new strategies for early detection and treatment of AD. We found that Tg2576 mice exhibited impaired pattern separation at the early preclinical stage. Based on previous studies suggesting a critical role of dentate gyrus (DG) in pattern separation, we investigated functional changes in DG of Tg2576 mice. We found that granule cells in DG (DG-GCs) in Tg2576 mice showed increased action potential firing in response to long depolarizations and reduced 4-AP sensitive K+-currents compared to DG-GCs in wild-type (WT) mice. Among Kv4 family channels, Kv4.1 mRNA expression in DG was significantly lower in Tg2576 mice. We confirmed that Kv4.1 protein expression was reduced in Tg2576, and this reduction was restored by antioxidant treatment. Hyperexcitable DG and impaired pattern separation in Tg2576 mice were also recovered by antioxidant treatment. These results highlight the hyperexcitability of DG-GCs as a pathophysiologic mechanism underlying early cognitive deficits in AD and Kv4.1 as a new target for AD pathogenesis in relation to increased oxidative stress.

PRKN is known to be involved with various mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control including mitochondrial structural changes. Parkinson’s disease (PD) with PRKN mutations is characterized by the preferential degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which has been suggested to result from the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. However, ultrastructural changes of mitochondria specifically in dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSC have rarely been analyzed. The main reason for this would be that the dopaminergic neurons cannot be distinguished directly among a mixture of iPSC-derived differentiated cells under electron microscopy. To selectively label dopaminergic neurons and analyze mitochondrial morphology at the ultrastructural level, we generated control and PRKN-mutated patient tyrosine hydroxylase reporter (TH-GFP) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Correlative light-electron microscopy analysis and live cell imaging of GFP-expressing dopaminergic neurons indicated that iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons had smaller and less functional mitochondria than those in non-dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, the formation of spheroid-shaped mitochondria, which was induced in control dopaminergic neurons by a mitochondrial uncoupler, was inhibited in the PRKN-mutated dopaminergic neurons. These results indicate that our established TH-GFP iPSC lines are useful for characterizing mitochondrial morphology, such as spheroid-shaped mitochondria, in dopaminergic neurons among a mixture of various cell types.

Correlations between the abundances of gut microbiota components at the genus level, the levels of serum metabolites, and pain-related behavioural parameters were analysed. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was applied to analyse the interaction networks of the differentially expressed serum metabolites. First, we found that the composition of the gut microbiota was different between rats with CCI-induced neuropathic pain and sham controls. At the genus level, the abundances of Helicobacter, Phascolarctobacterium, Christensenella, Blautia, Streptococcus, Rothia and Lactobacillus were significantly increased, whereas the abundances of Ignatzschineria, Butyricimonas, Escherichia, AF12, and Corynebacterium were significantly decreased. Additionally, 72 significantly differentially expressed serum metabolites and 17 significantly differentially expressed spinal cord metabolites were identified between the CCI rats and the sham rats. Finally, correlation analysis showed that changes in the gut microbiota was significantly correlated with changes in serum metabolite levels, suggesting that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is an important factor in modulating metabolic disturbances in the context of neuropathic pain. In conclusion, our research provides a novel perspective on the potential roles of the gut microbiota and related metabolites in neuropathic pain.","c(""Neuropathic pai "", ""Gut microbiota"", ""Metabolite profiles"", ""CCI model"")","c(""Chao Jiang"", ""Zhi-bing Wu"")","""Jiangbeyound0818@163.om"", ""wuzhibing2021@126.om""","09 March 2021"

The neuroprotective effect of probiotics against intestinal dysbacteriosis induced alternations needs to be determined either. In the present study, oral antibiotic mixture including Ampicillin, Streptomycin, and Clindamycin was utilized to induce intestinal dysbacteriosis in mice. Antibiotics application triggered mechanical allodynia in von frey test and spontaneous pain in open field test. It also resulted in increased anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and damaged spatial memory performance. After application of probiotics, the mechanical allodynia and spontaneous pain were alleviated significantly. The anxiety behaviors, depressive-like behaviors and recognitive performance were ameliorative as  well. By using Fos protein as a marker, it is found that the sensory, emotion and memory related brain regions were activated in mice with intestinal dysbacteriosis. Our study is not only helpful for enriching our basic knowledge for understanding the changed pain responses and related brain disorders in antibiotics-induced dysbacteriosis mice, but also beneficial for providing a more comprehensive mechanistic explanation for the regulation of antibiotics and probiotics on gut microbiota and relevant alternations in animal neurological behaviors.","c(""I testi al dysbacteriosis"", ""Behavior"", ""A tibiotics"", ""Probiotics"", ""Mice"")","c(""Xiao-Jun Wu"", ""Hui Yang"", ""Tao Chen"")","""wuxiaojun1975@yahoo.om"", ""kittyyh@nwpu.edu.n"", ""taohen1@foxmail.om""","06 March 2021"

We recently found that NHE6 directly interacts with secretory carrier membrane protein 5 (SCAMP5), and SCAMP5-dependent recruitment of NHE6 to SVs controls the strength of synaptic transmission by modulation of quantal size of glutamate release at rest. It is, however, unknown whether NHE6 recruitment by SCAMP5 plays a role during synaptic plasticity. Here, we found that the number of NHE6-positive presynaptic boutons was significantly increased by the chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). Since cLTP involves new synapse formation, our results indicated that NHE6 was recruited not only to the existing presynaptic boutons but also to the newly formed presynaptic boutons. Knock down of SCAMP5 completely abrogated the enhancement of NHE6 recruitment by cLTP. Interestingly, despite an increase in the number of NHE6-positive boutons by cLTP, the quantal size of glutamate release at the presynaptic terminals remained unaltered. Together with our recent results, our findings indicate that SCAMP5-dependent recruitment of NHE6 plays a critical role in manifesting presynaptic efficacy not only at rest but also during synaptic plasticity. Since both are autism candidate genes, reduced presynaptic efficacy by interfering with their interaction may underlie the molecular mechanism of synaptic dysfunction observed in autism.","c(""NHE6"", ""SCAMP5"", ""cLTP"", ""Presy aptic termi al"", ""Activity-depe de t sy aptic localizatio "", ""Sy aptic vesicle"", ""Presy aptic qua tal size"", ""Autism"")","Sunghoe Chang","sunghoe@snu.a.kr","04 March 2021"

Specifically, the projection from the prelimbic cortex (PL) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to regulate sensory and affective aspects of pain in a number of rodent models. Previous studies have shown that enhancement of glutamate signaling through the NAc by AMPAkines, a class of agents that specifically potentiate the function of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, reduces acute and persistent pain. However, it is not known whether postsynaptic potentiation of the NAc with these agents can achieve the full anti-nociceptive effects of PL activation. Here we compared the impact of AMPAkine treatment in the NAc with optogenetic activation of the PL on pain behaviors in rats. We found that not only does AMPAkine treatment partially reconstitute the PL inhibition of sensory withdrawals, it fully occludes the effect of the PL on reducing the aversive component of pain. These results indicate that the NAc is likely one of the key targets for the PL, especially in the regulation of pain aversion.

Here, we found the interactions between the amygdala and mPFC as upstream regulators of the hippocampus for IA memory reconsolidation. Pharmacological inactivation of the amygdala, mPFC, or hippocampus immediately after IA memory retrieval blocked IA memory enhancement. More importantly, inactivation of the amygdala or mPFC blocked the induction of c-Fos in the amygdala, mPFC, and hippocampus, whereas hippocampal blockade inhibited it only in the hippocampus. These observations suggest interactions between the amygdala and mPFC and they both function as upstream regulators of the hippocampus to reconsolidate IA memory.

This antioxidant enzyme is expressed throughout the brain, including the hippocampus. Recent evidence reveals that PRDX6 plays an important role in redox regulation and the modulation of several signaling molecules involved in fear regulation. Thus, we hypothesized that PRDX6 plays a role in the regulation of fear memory. We subjected a systemic Prdx6 knockout (Prdx6−/−) mice to trace fear conditioning and observed enhanced fear response after training. Intraventricular injection of lentivirus-carried mouse Prdx6 into the 3rd ventricle reduced the enhanced fear response in these knockout mice. Proteomic analysis followed by validation of western blot analysis revealed that several proteins in the MAPK pathway, such as NTRK2, AKT, and phospho-ERK1/2, cPLA2 were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of Prdx6−/− mice during the retrieval stage of contextual fear memory. The distribution of PRDX6 found in the astrocytes was also observed throughout the hippocampus. This study identifies PRDX6 as a participant in the regulation of fear response.

To understand the potential contribution of increased protein synthesis to the proteomic change in the TG striatal synaptosome, we performed RNA-sequencing analyses on both whole synaptosomal and synaptic polysome-enriched fractions. Comparative analyses showed a positive correlation only between the polysome-associated transcriptome and up-regulated proteome in the TG striatal synaptosome.

Previous studies have shown that a variety of internal factors and procedural variables can influence elevated plus maze behavior. Although some studies have suggested a link between behavior and plasma corticosterone levels, the relationships between them remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of experience with a battery of behavioral tests, the wall color of the closed arms, and illumination level on the behavior and plasma corticosterone responses in the elevated plus maze in male C57BL/6J mice. Mice were either subjected to a series of behavioral tests, including assessments of general health and neurological function, a light/dark transition test, and an open field test, or left undisturbed until the start of the elevated plus maze test. The mice with and without test battery experience were allowed to freely explore the elevated plus maze. The other two independent groups of naïve mice were tested in mazes with closed arms with different wall colors (clear, transparent blue, white, and black) or different illumination levels (5, 100, and 800 lx). Immediately after the test, blood was collected to measure plasma corticosterone concentrations. Mice with test battery experience showed a lower percentage of open arm time and entries and, somewhat paradoxically, had lower plasma corticosterone levels than the mice with no test battery experience. Mice tested in the maze with closed arms with clear walls exhibited higher open arm exploration than mice tested in the maze with closed arms with black walls, while there were no significant differences in plasma corticosterone levels between the different wall color conditions. Illumination levels had no significant effects on any measure. Our results indicate that experience with other behavioral tests and different physical features of the maze affect elevated plus maze behaviors. Increased open arm time and entries are conventionally interpreted as decreased anxiety-like behavior, while other possible interpretations are considered: open arm exploration may reflect heightened anxiety and panic-like reaction to a novel situation under certain conditions.

Intravenous infusion of blood–brain barrier-penetrating AAV-PHP.B expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of the mGAD65 promoter transduced the whole brain in an inhibitory neuron-specific manner.

To investigate these correlates, neural interactions are typically abstracted from spike trains of pairs of neurons accumulated over the course of many trials. However, the resultant averaged values do not lead to understanding of neural computation in which the responses of populations are highly variable even under identical external conditions. Accordingly, neural interactions within the population also show strong fluctuations. In the present study, we introduce an analysis method reflecting the temporal variation of neural interactions, in which cross-correlograms on rate estimates are applied via a latent dynamical systems model. Using this method, we were able to predict time-varying neural interactions within a single trial.

Thus, our analysis method revealed that neurons in the same groups communicate more as the population gets involved in the assigned task.

The use of genetically determined metabotypes (GDMs) to understand the role of genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions, in human complex traits has been recently proposed. However, this strategy has not been applied to human intelligence. Here we implemented a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using GDMs to assess the causal relationships between genetically determined metabolites and human intelligence.

The causal relationship was robust when sensitivity analyses were applied (PMR-Egger = 0.0001, PWeighted median = 6.29 × 10–6, PMR-PRESSO = 0.0007), and repeated analysis yielded consistent result (PIVW = 0.0087). Similarly, also dihomo-linoleate (20:2n6) and p-acetamidophenylglucuronide showed robust association with intelligence.

Previously, RNA analysis was widely used to study the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TBI; however, the relatively low correlation between the transcriptome and proteome revealed that RNA transcription abundance does not reliably predict protein abundance, which led to the emergence of proteomic research. In this study, an iTRAQ proteomics approach was applied to detect protein alterations after TBI on a large scale. A total of 3937 proteins were identified, and 146 proteins were significantly changed after TBI. Moreover, 23 upregulated proteins were verified by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), and fold changes in 16 proteins were consistent with iTRAQ outcomes. Transthyretin (Ttr) upregulation has been demonstrated at the transcriptional level, and this study further confirmed this at the protein level. After treatment with thyroxine (T4), which is transported by Ttr, the effects of T4 on neuronal histopathology and behavioral performance were determined in vivo (TBI + T4 group). Brain edema was alleviated, and the integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) improved. Escape latency in the Morris water maze (MWM) declined significantly compared with the group without T4 treatment. Modified neurological severity scores (mNSS) of the TBI + T4 group decreased from day 1 to day 7 post-TBI compared with the TBI + saline group. These results indicate that T4 treatment has potential to alleviate pathologic and behavioral abnormalities post-TBI. Protein alterations after T4 treatment were also detected by iTRAQ proteomics. Upregulation of proteins like Lgals3, Gfap and Apoe after TBI were reversed by T4 treatment. GO enrichment showed T4 mainly affected intermediate filament organization, cholesterol transportation and axonal regeneration. In summary, iTRAQ proteomics provides information about the impact of TBI on protein alterations and yields insight into underlying mechanisms and pathways involved in TBI and T4 treatment. Finally, Ttr and other proteins identified by iTRAQ may become potential novel treatment targets post-TBI.","c(""Traumatic brai i jury"", ""Qua titative proteomics"", ""Mass spectrometry (MS)"", ""Parallel reactio mo itori g (PRM)"", ""Thyroxi e"", ""Tra sthyreti "", ""Rat cortex"")","c(""Haoli Ma"", ""Yan Zhao"")","""mahaoli@whu.edu.n"", ""dotoryanzhao@whu.edu.n""","27 January 2021"

Previous studies have shown a role for genetics in the pathology of task-specific focal dystonia. However, to date, no causal gene has been reported for task-specific focal dystonia, including WC. In this study, we investigated the genetic background of a large Dutch family with autosomal dominant‒inherited WC that was negative for mutations in known dystonia genes. Whole exome sequencing identified 4 rare variants of unknown significance that segregated in the family. One candidate gene was selected for follow-up, Calcium Voltage-Gated Channel Subunit Alpha1 H, CACNA1H, due to its links with the known dystonia gene Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain Containing 17, KCTD17, and with paroxysmal movement disorders. Targeted resequencing of CACNA1H in 82 WC cases identified another rare, putative damaging variant in a familial WC case that did not segregate. Using structural modelling and functional studies in vitro, we show that both the segregating p.Arg481Cys variant and the non-segregating p.Glu1881Lys variant very likely cause structural changes to the Cav3.2 protein and lead to similar gains of function, as seen in an accelerated recovery from inactivation. Both mutant channels are thus available for re-activation earlier, which may lead to an increase in intracellular calcium and increased neuronal excitability. Overall, we conclude that rare functional variants in CACNA1H need to be interpreted very carefully, and additional studies are needed to prove that the p.Arg481Cys variant is the cause of WC in the large Dutch family.","c(""Writer’s cramp"", ""Focal dysto ia"", "" CACNA1H "", ""Rare varia ts"", ""Structural a d fu ctio al a alysis"")","Dineke S.

To understand the mechanisms behind the deficits of lysosomal GCase enzyme activity in idiopathic PD, this study utilized a large cohort of fibroblast cells from control subjects and PD patients with and without mutations in the GBA gene (N370S mutation) (control, n = 15; idiopathic PD, n = 31; PD with GBA N370S mutation, n = 6). The current data demonstrates that idiopathic PD fibroblasts devoid of any mutations in the GBA gene also exhibit reduction in lysosomal GCase activity, similar to those with the GBA N370S mutation. This reduced GCase enzyme activity in idiopathic PD cells was accompanied by decreased expression of the GBA trafficking receptor, LIMP2, and increased ER retention of the GBA protein in these cells. Importantly, in idiopathic PD fibroblasts LIMP2 protein levels correlated significantly with GCase activity, which was not the case in control subjects or in genetic PD GBA N370S cells.

It has been hypothesized that the chronic pruritus may result from sensitization of itch-signaling pathways but the mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, we established a mouse model of chronic compression of dorsal root ganglion (CCD) and injected various pruritogenic and algogenic agents intradermally to the calf skin ipsilateral to the compressed dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Compared to the naïve mice, a significant increase in itch-related behaviors was observed in the CCD mice after the injection of pruritogens including histamine and BAM8-22, but not after the injection of capsaicin, although all the above agents evoked enhanced pain-related behaviors toward the injected site. In addition, we investigated if pruritogen-evoked activities of DRG neurons were enhanced in this model. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that compressed DRG neurons exhibited enhanced responses to histamine and BAM8-22. Immunoflorescent staining also showed that the histamine receptor H1 and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 were significantly upregulated in DRG neurons. Our findings indicated that the sensitization of primary pruriceptive neurons may underlie the enhanced itch sensation after chronic compression of DRG in the mice, and may play a role in chronic pruritus in neurological diseases.","c(""DRG compressio "", ""Pruriceptor"", ""Itch"", ""Hyperki esis"", ""Behavior"")","Chao Ma","mahao@ibms.ams.n","19 January 2021"

We observed that mitochondrial movement was impaired in dysbindin knockout mouse neurons. Reduced mitochondrial motility caused by dysbindin deficiency decreased the density of mitochondria in the distal part of axons. Moreover, the transport and distribution of mitochondria were regulated by the association between dysbindin and p150glued. Furthermore, altered mitochondrial distribution in axons led to disrupted calcium dynamics, showing abnormal calcium influx in presynaptic terminals.

To explore it, we examined neural activities of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats performing cue-guided two-alternative forced-choice tasks. In a task requiring rats to discriminate stimuli based on auditory cue, the simultaneous presentation of an uninformative visual cue substantially strengthened mPFC neurons' capability of auditory discrimination mainly through enhancing the response to the preferred cue. Doing this also increased the number of neurons revealing a cue preference. If the task was changed slightly and a visual cue, like the auditory, denoted a specific behavioral direction, mPFC neurons frequently showed a different CMI pattern with an effect of cross-modal enhancement best evoked in information-congruent multisensory trials. In a choice free task, however, the majority of neurons failed to show a cross-modal enhancement effect and cue preference.

Among the top genetic associations, zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) gene encodes a zinc finger protein, associated with SZ and biolar disorder (BD). Copy number variants (CNVs) of ZNF804A have been observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), anxiety disorder, and BD, suggesting that ZNF804A is a dosage sensitive gene for brain development. However, its molecular functions have not been fully determined. Our previous interactomic study revealed that ZNF804A interacts with multiple proteins to control protein translation and neural development. ZNF804A is localized in the cytoplasm and neurites in the human cortex and is expressed in various types of neurons, including pyramidal, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and Purkinje neurons in mouse brain. To further examine the effect of gene dosage of ZNF804A on neurite morphology, both knockdown and overexpression of ZNF804A in primary neuronal cells significantly attenuate dendritic complex and spine formation. To determine the factors mediating these phenotypes, interestingly, three binding proteins of ZNF804A, galectin 1 (LGALS1), fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1 (FEZ1) and ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), show different effects on reversing the deficits. LGALS1 and FEZ1 stimulate neurite outgrowth at basal level but RPSA shows no effect. Intriguingly, LGALS1 but not FEZ1, reverses the neurite outgrowth deficits induced by ZNF804A knockdown. However, FEZ1 and RPSA but not LGALS1, can ameliorate ZNF804A overexpression-mediated dendritic abnormalities.

Stressful experiences in early life are considered one of the risk factors for chronic depressive symptoms, along with an abnormal inflammatory response in later life. Although increased inflammatory activity has been identified in patients with depression, the cause of long-lasting depressive states is still unclear. To identify the effects of cumulative mild stress in brain development periods, we generated a young adult depression mouse model exposed to cumulative mild stress (CPMS; cumulative mild prenatal stress, mild maternal separation, and mild social defeat) to mimic early life adversities. CPMS mice exhibited more long-lasting anxiety and depression-like behaviors than groups exposed to single or double combinations of mild stress in young adult age. Using the molecular works, we found that inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-17, upregulated microglial activation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex of CPMS mice. In the brains of CPMS mice, we also identified changes in the T helper (Th)-17 cell population as well as differentiation. Finally, anti-IL-17 treatment rescued anxiety and depression-like behavior in CPMS mice. In conclusion, we found that cumulative mild stress promoted long-lasting depressive symptoms in CPMS mice through the upregulation of IL-17. We suggest that the CPMS model may be useful to study young adult depression and expect that IL-17 may be an important therapeutic target for depression in young adults.","c(""Cumulative mild stress"", ""Brai developme t"", ""You g adulthood"", ""Depressio -like behavior"", ""A xiety"", ""I flammatio "", ""I terleuki -17"")","Keun-A Chang","keuna705@gahon.a.kr","13 January 2021"

Each BDNF transcript is composed by one out of 11 alternatively spliced exons containing the 5′untranslated region (UTR), and one common exon encompassing the coding sequence (CDS) and the 3′UTR with two variants (short and long). In neurons, BDNF mRNA variants have a distinct subcellular distribution, constituting a “spatial code”, with exon 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 located in neuronal somata, exon 4 extending into proximal dendrites, and exon 2 and 6 reaching distal dendrites. We previously showed that the CDS encodes constitutive dendritic targeting signals (DTS) and that both the 3′UTR-short and the 3′UTR-long contain activity-dependent DTS. However, the role of individual 5′UTR exons in mRNA sorting remains unclear. Here, we tested the ability of each different BDNF 5′UTRs to affect the subcellular localization of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter mRNA. We found that exon 2 splicing isoforms (2a, 2b, and 2c) induced a constitutive dendritic targeting of the GFP reporter mRNA towards distal dendritic segments. The other isoforms did not affect GFP-mRNA dendritic trafficking. Through a bioinformatic analysis, we identified five unique cis-elements in exon 2a, 2b, and 2c which might contribute to building a DTS.

N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP and LTD play especially crucial roles in these functions, and their expression depends on changes in the number and single channel conductance of the major ionotropic glutamate receptor α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) located on the postsynaptic membrane. Structural changes in dendritic spines comprise the morphological platform and support for molecular changes in the execution of synaptic plasticity and memory storage. At the molecular level, spine morphology is directly determined by actin cytoskeleton organization within the spine and indirectly stabilized and consolidated by scaffold proteins at the spine head. Palmitoylation, as a uniquely reversible lipid modification with the ability to regulate protein membrane localization and trafficking, plays significant roles in the structural and functional regulation of LTP and LTD. Altered structural plasticity of dendritic spines is also considered a hallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders, while genetic evidence strongly links abnormal brain function to impaired palmitoylation. Numerous studies have indicated that palmitoylation contributes to morphological spine modifications. In this review, we have gathered data showing that the regulatory proteins that modulate the actin network and scaffold proteins related to AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission also undergo palmitoylation and play roles in modifying spine architecture during structural plasticity.","c(""Lipid posttra slatio al modificatio "", ""Lo g term pote tiatio (LTP)"", ""Lo g term depressio (LTD)"", ""Structural plasticity"", ""AMPAR"", ""Acti cytoskeleto "", ""Rho GTPases"")","c(""Benjun Ji"", ""Małgorzata Skup"")","""b.ji@nenki.edu.pl"", ""m.skup@nenki.edu.pl""","11 January 2021"

In addition, the expression pattern of miR-690 was similar to the sucrose preference of the same group in WT and Fkbp5 KO mice. miR-690 was injected into the mPFC using a recombinant adeno-associated virus mediated gene delivery method. After recovery, miR-690 overexpressing mice were exposed to restraint stress for 2 weeks. In the sucrose preference test and forced swim test, the stressed miR-690 overexpressing mice showed higher sucrose preference and lower immobility time, respectively, than stressed mice injected with the control virus. In the novel object recognition test, the stressed miR-690 overexpressing mice interacted longer with the novel object than those injected with the control virus.

The neuronal activation of these brain regions during the OBAT indicates that these brain regions are necessary for the regulation of attention in this test. This was supported by excitotoxic lesioning of these brain regions, leading to impaired attention without causing locomotor dysfunction.

One form of SGM is aneuploidy—the gain and/or loss of chromosomes—which is associated with mitotic spindle defects. The mitotic spindle orientation determines cleavage plane positioning and, therefore, neural progenitor cell (NPC) fate during cerebral cortical development. Here we report receptor-mediated signaling by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a novel extracellular signal that influences cleavage plane orientation and produces alterations in SGM by inducing aneuploidy during murine cortical neurogenesis. LPA is a bioactive lipid whose actions are mediated by six G protein-coupled receptors, LPA1–LPA6. RNAscope and qPCR assessment of all six LPA receptor genes, and exogenous LPA exposure in LPA receptor (Lpar)-null mice, revealed involvement of Lpar1 and Lpar2 in the orientation of the mitotic spindle. Lpar1 signaling increased non-vertical cleavage in vivo by disrupting cell–cell adhesion, leading to breakdown of the ependymal cell layer. In addition, genomic alterations were significantly increased after LPA exposure, through production of chromosomal aneuploidy in NPCs. These results identify LPA as a receptor-mediated signal that alters both NPC fate and genomes during cortical neurogenesis, thus representing an extracellular signaling mechanism that can produce stable genomic changes in NPCs and their progeny. Normal LPA signaling in early life could therefore influence both the developing and adult brain, whereas its pathological disruption could contribute to a range of neurological and psychiatric diseases, via long-lasting somatic genomic alterations.","c(""LPA"", ""Lysophospholipid"", ""GPCR"", ""Neural proge itor cells"", ""NPC"", ""Adhere s ju ctio s"", ""Somatic ge omic mosaicism"", ""A euploidy"", ""Cleavage pla e"", ""Hydrocephalus"")","Jerold Chun","jhun@sbpdisovery.org","14 December 2020"

Across various human brain regions, basal dendritic complexity is known to increase along a caudal-to-rostral gradient. We recently discovered that basal dendritic complexity of layer II/III cortical pyramidal neurons in the mouse increases along a caudomedial-to-rostrolateral gradient spanning multiple regions, but at the time, no molecules were known to regulate that exquisite pattern. Integrin subunits have been implicated in dendritic development, and the subunit with the strongest associations with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability is integrin β3 (Itgb3). In mice, global knockout of Itgb3 leads to autistic-like neuroanatomy and behavior. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Itgb3 is required for increasing dendritic complexity along the recently discovered tangential gradient among layer II/III cortical pyramidal neurons. We targeted a subset of layer II/III cortical pyramidal neurons for Itgb3 loss-of-function via Cre-loxP-mediated excision of Itgb3. We tracked the rostrocaudal and mediolateral position of the targeted neurons and reconstructed their dendritic arbors. In contrast to controls, the basal dendritic complexity of Itgb3 mutant neurons was not related to their cortical position. Basal dendritic complexity of mutant and control neurons differed because of overall changes in branch number across multiple branch orders (primary, secondary, etc.), rather than any changes in the average length at those branch orders. Furthermore, dendritic spine density was related to cortical position in control but not mutant neurons. Thus, the autism susceptibility gene Itgb3 is required for establishing a tangential pattern of basal dendritic complexity among layer II/III cortical pyramidal neurons, suggesting an early role for this molecule in the developing brain.","c(""I tegri beta 3"", ""I tegri β3"", ""Itgb3"", ""De dritic complexity"", ""De drite"", ""Pyramidal euro "", ""De dritoge esis"", ""Autism"", ""I utero electroporatio "", ""Mosaic a alysis"")","George S.

Sleep deprivation induces significant changes in gene transcription in many brain regions, with the hippocampus particularly susceptible to acute sleep deprivation. However, less is known about the impacts of sleep deprivation on post-transcriptional gene regulation. To identify the effects of sleep deprivation on the translatome, we took advantage of the RiboTag mouse line to express HA-labeled Rpl22 in CaMKIIα neurons to selectively isolate and sequence mRNA transcripts associated with ribosomes in excitatory neurons. We found 198 differentially expressed genes in the ribosome-associated mRNA subset after sleep deprivation. In comparison with previously published data on gene expression in the hippocampus after sleep deprivation, we found that the subset of genes affected by sleep deprivation was considerably different in the translatome compared with the transcriptome, with only 49 genes regulated similarly. Interestingly, we found 478 genes differentially regulated by sleep deprivation in the transcriptome that were not significantly regulated in the translatome of excitatory neurons. Conversely, there were 149 genes differentially regulated by sleep deprivation in the translatome but not in the whole transcriptome. Pathway analysis revealed differences in the biological functions of genes exclusively regulated in the transcriptome or translatome, with protein deacetylase activity and small GTPase binding regulated in the transcriptome and unfolded protein binding, kinase inhibitor activity, neurotransmitter receptors and circadian rhythms regulated in the translatome.

However, it remains poorly understood whether and how VPS35 deficiency or mutation contributes to PD pathogenesis; specifically, the studies that have examined VPS35 thus far have differed in results and methodologies. We generated a VPS35 D620N mouse model using a Rosa26-based transgene expression platform to allow expression in a spatial manner, so as to better address these discrepancies. Here, aged (20-months-old) mice were first subjected to behavioral tests. Subsequently, DAB staining analysis of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neurons with the marker for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was performed. Next, HPLC was used to determine dopamine levels, along with levels of its two metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in the striatum.

Patients with SCA42 exhibit a pure form of cerebellar ataxia. We encountered a patient with the p.Arg1715His mutation, suffering from intractable resting tremor, particularly head tremor. This symptom improved with the administration of low-dose of zonisamide (ZNS), a T-type calcium channel blocker effective for treating Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy. Previous electrophysiological studies showed that the voltage dependence of this mutant CaV3.1 was shifted toward the positive potential. This abnormal shift was considered a factor related to disease onset and symptoms. In this study, we performed whole-cell recordings of GFP-expressing HEK293T cells that expressed wild-type or mutant CaV3.1 and investigated the changes in the abnormal shift of voltage dependence of the mutant CaV3.1. The results showed that ZNS in an amount equivalent to the patient’s internal dose significantly ameliorated the abnormal shift in the mutant CaV3.1, giving values close to those in the wild-type. On the other hand, ZNS did not affect the voltage dependence of wild-type CaV3.1. Because CaV3.1 is known to be involved in tremogenesis, modulation of the voltage dependence of mutant CaV3.1 by ZNS might have contributed to improvement in the intractable tremor of our patient with SCA42. Moreover, efonidipine, another T-type calcium channel blocker, had no effect on tremors in our patient with SCA42 and did not improve the abnormal shift in the voltage dependence of the mutant CaV3.1.

The modulation of the neuronal transcriptome in response to learning depends on transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. DNA methylation writers and readers regulate the activity-dependent genomic program required for memory consolidation. The most abundant DNA methylation reader, the Methyl CpG binding domain protein 2 (MeCP2), has been shown to regulate alternative splicing, but whether it establishes splicing events important for memory consolidation has not been investigated. In this study, we identified the alternative splicing profile of the mouse hippocampus in basal conditions and after a spatial learning experience, and investigated the requirement of MeCP2 for these processes. We observed that spatial learning triggers a wide-range of alternative splicing events in transcripts associated with structural and functional remodeling and that virus-mediated knockdown of MeCP2 impairs learning-dependent post-transcriptional responses of mature hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we found that MeCP2 preferentially affected the splicing modalities intron retention and exon skipping and guided the alternative splicing of distinct set of genes in baseline conditions and after learning. Lastly, comparative analysis of the MeCP2-regulated transcriptome with the alternatively spliced mRNA pool, revealed that MeCP2 disruption alters the relative abundance of alternatively spliced isoforms without affecting the overall mRNA levels. Taken together, our findings reveal that adult hippocampal MeCP2 is required to finetune alternative splicing events in basal conditions, as well as in response to spatial learning.

Recent studies have identified correlations between altered retrotransposon expression and the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a subset of patients. The risk of an individual developing ALS is dependent on an interaction of genetic variants and subsequent modifiers during life. These modifiers could include environmental factors, which can lead to epigenetic and genomic changes, such as somatic mutations, occurring in the neuronal cells that degenerate as the disease develops. There are more than 1 million L1 copies in the human genome today, but only 80–100 L1 loci in the reference genome are considered to be retrotransposition-competent (RC) and an even smaller number of these RC-L1s loci are highly active. We hypothesise that RC-L1s could affect normal cellular function through their mutagenic potential conferred by their ability to retrotranspose in neuronal cells and through DNA damage caused by the endonuclease activity of the L1-encoded ORF2 protein. To investigate whether either an increase in the genomic burden of RC-L1s or epigenetic changes to RC-L1s altering their expression, could play a role in disease development, we chose a set of seven well characterised genomic RC-L1 loci that were reported earlier to be highly active in a cellular L1 retrotransposition reporter assay or serve as major source elements for germline and/or somatic retrotransposition events. Analysis of the insertion allele frequency of five polymorphic RC-L1s, out of the set of seven, for their presence or absence, did not identify an increased number individually or when combined in individuals with the disease. However, we did identify reduced levels of methylation of RC-L1s in the motor cortex of those individuals with both familial and sporadic ALS compared to control brains.

Transient transfection of EAAC1 reduced CoCl2-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Based on this result, upregulation of EAAC1 expression by CoCl2 is thought to represent a compensatory response against oxidative stress in an acute hypoxic state. We further demonstrated that pretreatment with Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) rescued CoCl2-induced upregulation of EAAC1 and tau expression.

Rodent models that recapitulate aggressive Aβ and/or the pathology of neurofibrillary tangles are essential for AD research. Accordingly, non-invasive early detection systems in these animal models are required to evaluate the phenotypic changes, elucidate the mechanism of disease progression, and facilitate development of novel therapeutic approaches. Although many behavioral tests efficiently reveal cognitive impairments at the later stage of the disease in AD models, it has been challenging to detect such impairments at the early stage. To address this issue, we subjected 4–6-month-old male AppNL−G−F/NL−G−F knock-in (App-KI) mice to touchscreen-based location discrimination (LD), different object–location paired-associate learning (dPAL), and reversal learning tests, and compared the results with those of the classical Morris water maze test. These tests are mainly dependent on the brain regions prone to Aβ accumulation at the earliest stages of the disease. At 4–6 months, considered to represent the early stage of disease when mice exhibit initial deposition of Aβ and slight gliosis, the classical Morris water maze test revealed no difference between groups, whereas touchscreen-based LD and dPAL tasks revealed significant impairments in task performance. Our report is the first to confirm that a systematic touchscreen-based behavioral test battery can sensitively detect the early stage of cognitive decline in an AD-linked App-KI mouse model.

Based on these findings, the recent cloning of the Sigma-2 receptor (σ2R) led us to investigate its potential role as a regulator of opioid analgesia and of pain hypersensitivity in σ2R knockout mice. In contrast to σ1R deficient mice, σ2R knockout mice developed mechanical allodynia following establishment of chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, which was alleviated by the σ1R antagonist S1RA. The analgesic effects of morphine, [D-Ala, N-MePhe, Gly-ol]-encephalin (DAMGO) and β-endorphin increased in σ1R−/− mice and diminished in σ2R−/− mice. The analgesic effect of morphine was increased in σ2R−/− mice by treatment with S1RA.

Additionally, translin knockout (KO) mice, which lack translin/trax, exhibit some of the behavioral abnormalities found in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (fragile X mental retardation protein-FMRP-KO mice). Therefore, identifying signaling pathways interacting with translin/trax to support persistent synaptic plasticity is a translationally relevant goal. Here, as a first step to achieve this goal, we have assessed the requirement of translin/trax for multiple hippocampal synaptic plasticity paradigms that rely on distinct molecular mechanisms. We found that mice lacking translin/trax exhibited selective impairment in a form of persistent hippocampal plasticity, which requires postsynaptic protein kinase A (PKA) activity. In contrast, enduring forms of plasticity that are dependent on presynaptic PKA were unaffected. Furthermore, these mice did not display exaggerated metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term synaptic depression (mGluR-LTD), a hallmark of the FMRP KO mice. On the contrary, translin KO mice exhibited deficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dependent LTD, a phenotype not observed in the FMRP knockouts.

However, little is known about the control of acute and chronic itch by descending signals from the brain to the SDH. In this study, using genetic approaches that enable cell-type and circuit-specific functional manipulation, we reveal an intrinsic potential of locus coeruleus (LC)-noradrenergic (NAergic) neurons that project to the SDH to control acute and chronic itch. Activation and silencing of SDH-projecting LC-NAergic neurons reduced and enhanced scratching behavior, respectively, in models of histamine-dependent and -independent acute itch. Furthermore, in a model of chronic itch associated with contact dermatitis, repetitive scratching behavior was suppressed by the activation of the descending LC-NAergic pathway and by knocking out NA transporters specific to descending LC-NAergic neurons using a CRISPR-Cas9 system. Moreover, patch-clamp recording using spinal slices showed that noradrenaline facilitated inhibitory synaptic inputs onto gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-expressing SDH neurons, a neuronal subset known to be essential for itch transmission.

The voltage-gated proton channel, Hv1, functionally expressed in microglia has been implicated in microglia polarization and oxidative stress in ischemic stroke. Here, we investigate whether Hv1 mediates microglial/macrophage activation and aggravates secondary damage following spinal cord injury (SCI). Following contusion SCI, wild-type (WT) mice showed significant tissue damage, white matter damage and impaired motor recovery. However, mice lacking Hv1 (Hv1−/−) showed significant white matter sparing and improved motor recovery. The improved motor recovery in Hv1−/− mice was associated with decreased interleukin-1β, reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species production and reduced neuronal loss. Further, deficiency of Hv1 directly influenced microglia activation as noted by decrease in microglia numbers, soma size and reduced outward rectifier K+ current density in Hv1−/− mice compared to WT mice at 7 d following SCI.

The great majority of AD cases arise sporadically with a late onset after 65 years of age (LOAD). However, rare familial cases of AD can occur due to dominant mutations in a small number of genes that cause an early onset prior to 65 years of age (EOfAD). As EOfAD and LOAD share similar pathologies and disease progression, analysis of EOfAD genetic models may give insight into both subtypes of AD. Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is genetically associated with both EOfAD and LOAD and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between both forms of AD. Currently, the role of SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis is unclear. To understand the molecular consequences of SORL1 mutation, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the orthologous gene in zebrafish. We generated an EOfAD-like mutation, V1482Afs, and a putatively null mutation, to investigate whether EOfAD-like mutations in sorl1 display haploinsufficiency by acting through loss-of-function mechanisms. We performed mRNA-sequencing on whole brains, comparing wild type fish with their siblings heterozygous for EOfAD-like or putatively loss-of-function mutations in sorl1, or transheterozygous for these mutations. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small number of differentially expressed genes due to the sorl1 genotypes. We also performed enrichment analysis on all detectable genes to obtain a more complete view on changes to gene expression by performing three methods of gene set enrichment analysis, then calculated an overall significance value using the harmonic mean p-value. This identified subtle effects on expression of genes involved in energy production, mRNA translation and mTORC1 signalling in both the EOfAD-like and null mutant brains, implying that these effects are due to sorl1 haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, we also observed changes to expression of genes occurring only in the EOfAD-mutation carrier brains, suggesting gain-of-function effects. Transheterozygosity for the EOfAD-like and null mutations (i.e. lacking wild type sorl1), caused apparent effects on iron homeostasis and other transcriptome changes distinct from the single-mutation heterozygous fish. Our results provide insight into the possible early brain molecular effects of an EOfAD mutation in human SORL1.

The present study uses electron microscopy (EM) and immunogold EM to document the different categories of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) and pits (CCP) in axons compared to soma/dendrites, and the depolarization-induced redistribution of clathrin in these two polarized compartments of the neuron. The size of CCVs in presynaptic terminals (~ 40 nm; similar to the size of synaptic vesicles) is considerably smaller than the size of CCVs in soma/dendrites (~ 90 nm). Furthermore, neuronal stimulation induces an increase in the number of CCV/CCP in presynaptic terminals, but a decrease in soma/dendrites. Immunogold labeling of clathrin revealed that in presynaptic terminals under resting conditions, the majority of clathrin molecules are unassembled and concentrated outside of synaptic vesicle clusters. Upon depolarization with high K+, label for clathrin became scattered among de-clustered synaptic vesicles and moved closer to the presynaptic active zone. In contrast to axons, clathrin-labeled CCVs and CCPs were prominent in soma/dendrites under resting conditions, and became inconspicuous upon depolarization with high K+. Thus, EM examination suggests that the regulation and mechanism of clathrin-mediated endocytosis differ between axon and dendrite, and that clathrin redistributes differently in these two neuronal compartments upon depolarization.","c(""Electro microscopy"", ""Clathri -coated vesicles"", ""Clathri -coated pits"", ""E docytosis"", ""Sy aptic vesicle"", ""Multivesicular body"", ""Glutamate receptors"", ""Tra sferri receptors"")","Jung-Hwa Tao-Cheng","hengs@ninds.nih.gov","16 October 2020"

However, it is still unclear whether α2AP plays a role in the memory process. The present study demonstrated that adult hippocampal neurogenesis and remote spatial memory were enhanced by the injection of an anti-α2AP neutralizing antibody in WT mice, while the injection of α2AP reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired remote spatial memory, suggesting that α2AP is a negative regulator in memory processing. The present study also found that the levels of α2AP in the brains of old mice were higher than those in young mice, and a negative correlation between the α2AP level and spatial working memory. In addition, aging-dependent brain oxidative stress and hippocampal inflammation were attenuated by α2AP deficiency.

Despite the recent emphasis on the importance of the intrinsic excitability related to learning and memory, the direct correlation between the intrinsic excitability of PCs and OKR learning has not been tested. In the present study, by utilizing the whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we compared the responses of cerebellar PCs to somatic current injection between the control and learned groups.

Therefore, in this study, we used peptidome analysis to identify differentially expressed peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neonates with HIBD or controls, which may give a foundation for finding new promising drugs of neonatal HIBD. CSF samples were collected from neonates with HIBD (n = 4) or controls (n = 4). ITRAQ LC–MS/MS was used to identify differentially expressed peptides between two groups. A total of 35 differentially expressed peptides from 25 precursor proteins were identified. The 2671.5 Da peptide (HSQFIGYPITLFVEKER), one of the down-regulated peptides in neonatal HIBD, is a fragment of heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90α/HSP90AA1). Results of bioinformatics analysis showed that HSP90α/HSP90AA1 was located in the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network hub and was involved in the NOD-LIKE receptor (NLR) signaling pathway. This peptide, we named it Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Damage Associated Peptide (HIBDAP), is a hydrophilic peptide with high stability and has a long half-life of 3.5 h in mammalian reticulocytes. It was demonstrated that TAT-HIBDAP could successfully enter PC12 cells and further into the nucleus. After HIBDAP pretreatment and 6 h of OGD treatment, low concentrations of HIBDAP increased the survival rate of cells, except 40 μM had a toxic effect. Safe concentrations of HIBDAP reduced pyroptosis of PC12 cells under OGD, except 20 μM had no effect, by suppressing expressions of NLRP3, ASC and Caspase-1 except NLRP1. The results of our study identified the characterization and expression profiles of peptides in CSF of neonatal HIBD.

Here we explored the functional coupling of the amygdala to spinal nociception. We found that pharmacological activation of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) increased the activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons; and this effect was blocked by optogenetic silencing of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) positive CeA neurons. A kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist (U-69,593) was administered into the CeA by microdialysis. KOR was targeted because of their role in averse-affective behaviors through actions in limbic brain regions. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made of CeA neurons or spinal dorsal horn neurons in anesthetized transgenic Crh-Cre rats. Neurons responded more strongly to noxious than innocuous stimuli. U-69,593 increased the responses of CeA and spinal neurons to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation of peripheral tissues. The facilitatory effect of the agonist was blocked by optical silencing of CRF-CeA neurons though light activation of halorhodopsin expressed in these neurons by viral-vector. The CRF system in the amygdala has been implicated in aversiveness and pain modulation. The results suggest that the amygdala can modulate spinal nociceptive processing in a positive direction through CRF-CeA neurons and that KOR activation in the amygdala (CeA) has pro-nociceptive effects.","c(""Amygdala"", ""Kappa opioid receptor"", ""Spi al dorsal hor "", ""Nociceptio "", ""Optoge etics"")","Volker Neugebauer","volker.neugebauer@ttuhs.edu","18 September 2020"

Activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor and breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential are key events during glutamate toxicity. Due to its manifold functions in nervous system physiology, however, the NMDA receptor is not well suited as a drug target. To identify novel compounds that act downstream of toxic NMDA receptor signaling and can protect mitochondria from glutamate toxicity, we developed a cell viability screening assay in primary mouse cortical neurons. In a proof-of-principle screen we tested 146 natural products and 424 FDA-approved drugs for their ability to protect neurons against NMDA-induced cell death. We confirmed several known neuroprotective drugs that include Dutasteride, Enalapril, Finasteride, Haloperidol, and Oxybutynin, and we identified neuroprotective properties of Elvitegravir. Using live imaging of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester-labelled primary cortical neurons, we found that Elvitegravir, Dutasteride, and Oxybutynin attenuated the NMDA-induced breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Patch clamp electrophysiological recordings in NMDA receptor-expressing HEK293 cell lines and primary mouse hippocampal neurons revealed that Elvitegravir does not act at the NMDA receptor and does not affect the function of glutamatergic synapses.

To address this issue, in this study, we have focused on the presynapses of layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in adult Cyfip2 heterozygous (Cyfip2+/−) mice. Electrophysiological analyses revealed an enhancement in the presynaptic short-term plasticity induced by high-frequency stimuli in Cyfip2+/− neurons compared with wild-type neurons. Since presynaptic mitochondria play an important role in buffering presynaptic Ca2+, which is directly associated with the short-term plasticity, we analyzed presynaptic mitochondria using electron microscopic images of the mPFC. Compared with wild-type mice, the number, but not the volume or cristae density, of mitochondria in both presynaptic boutons and axonal processes in the mPFC layer 5 of Cyfip2+/− mice was reduced. Consistent with an identification of mitochondrial proteins in a previously established CYFIP2 interactome, CYFIP2 was detected in a biochemically enriched mitochondrial fraction of the mouse mPFC.

We previously generated a novel transgenic mouse strain, Bdnf-Luciferase (Luc), to monitor changes in Bdnf expression; however, it was difficult to detect brain-derived signals in the strain using BLI with d-luciferin, probably because of incomplete substrate distribution and light penetration. We demonstrate that TokeOni, which uniformly distributes throughout the whole mouse body after systematic injection and produces a near-infrared bioluminescence light, was suitable for detecting signals from the brain of the Bdnf-Luc mouse. We clearly detected brain-derived bioluminescence signals that crossed the skin and skull after intraperitoneal injection of TokeOni. However, repeated BLI using TokeOni should be limited, because repeated injection of TokeOni on the same day reduced the bioluminescence signal, presumably by product inhibition. We successfully visualized kainic acid-induced Bdnf expression in the hippocampus and sensory stimulation-induced Bdnf expression in the visual cortex. Taken together, non-invasive near-infrared BLI using Bdnf-Luc mice with TokeOni allowed us to evaluate alterations in BDNF levels in the living mouse brain.

Interestingly, REST/NRSF nuclear translocation and signaling, as well as mGluR5 signaling are altered in the presence of mutant huntingtin. It remains unclear whether mGluR5 can modulate Wnt and REST/NRSF signaling under physiological conditions and whether this modulation is altered in Huntington’s disease (HD). Using primary corticostriatal neurons derived from wild type mouse embryos, we find that targeting mGluR5 using the agonist, DHPG, or the negative allosteric modulator, CTEP, modulates REST/NRSF expression by regulating the assembly of N-cadherin/ β-catenin complex in a Src kinase-dependent manner. We have validated our in vitro findings in vivo using two HD mouse models. Specifically, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 in zQ175 mice and genetic ablation of mGluR5 in BACHD mice corrected the pathological activation of Src and rescued REST/NRSF-dependent signaling.

To further understand the roles of the 5-HT system implicated in developmental disorders such as ASD, comparison with model animals exhibiting different phenotypes may be useful. In this study, we investigated the relationship between sociability and the magnitude of 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) activation-induced outward currents from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the PFC, because a mouse model of Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; another developmental disorder exhibiting low innate anxiety and high sociability) reportedly showed larger 5-HT-induced currents. To investigate whether the 5-HT1AR activation-induced outward currents are involved in the endophenotype determination of social behavior, we examined 15q dup mice with a phenotype opposite to WBS. We found 5-HT elicited significantly larger outward currents in 15q dup mice than in WT controls, regardless of sociability. In contrast, baclofen-induced GABAB receptor-mediated outward currents were not significantly different between genotypes, although GABAB receptor was coupled to Gi/o as well as 5-HT1A. Further, we found the larger 5-HT1AR-mediated currents in 15q dup mice did not affect the magnitude of inhibitory action of NMDA receptor functions.

Recurrent reactivation of neural representations acquired from a traumatic event is thought to contribute to the indelibility of fear memory. Given a well-established role of hippocampus for memory reactivation, hippocampus is likely involved in consolidation process of fear memory. However, evidence suggests that formation of fear memory to a discrete sensory cue is hippocampus-independent. Here, using a pharmacological reversible inactivation of dorsal hippocampus in auditory cued fear conditioning by local infusion of muscimol, we demonstrate in mice that hippocampus is critical for remote memory formation of learned fear to the discrete sensory cue. Muscimol infusion before conditioning did not affect formation of recent auditory fear memory as previously reported. Same muscimol infusion, however, impaired remote auditory fear memory. Muscimol infusion before remote test of auditory fear memory did not affect memory retrieval, indicating hippocampus is not a brain site for storage of remote cued fear memory. Moreover, memory reactivation enforced by re-exposure to the conditioned tone could compensate for hippocampal inactivation, as memory-reactivated mice showed normal remote auditory fear memory despite hippocampal inactivation.

This study aimed to understand the role of TMEM175 in lysosomal function of neurons and neuronal injury following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). A middle-cerebral-artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was established in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in vivo, and cultured neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in vitro. We found that the protein level of TMEM175 decreased after cerebral I/R injury and that TMEM175 overexpression ameliorated MCAO/R-induced brain-cell death and neurobehavioral deficits in vivo. Furthermore, these results were recapitulated in cultured neurons. Acridine orange (AO) staining, as well as LysoSensor Green DND-189, cathepsin-B (CTSB), and cathepsin-D (CTSD) activities, showed that TMEM175 deficiency inhibited the hydrolytic function of lysosomes by affecting lysosomal pH. In contrast, TMEM175 upregulation reversed OGD/R-induced lysosomal dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial accumulation in cultured neurons. TMEM175 deficiency induced by cerebral I/R injury leads to compromised lysosomal pH stability, thus inhibiting the hydrolytic function of lysosomes.

Although DA defects are found in autistic patients, it is not well defined how the DA pathways are altered in ASD and whether DA can be utilized as a potential therapeutic agent for ASD. To this end, we employed a phenotypic and a genetic ASD model, i.e., Black and Tan BRachyury T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice and Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) mice, respectively. Immunostaining of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to mark dopaminergic neurons revealed an overall reduction in the TH expression in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and dorsal striatum of BTBR mice, as compared to C57BL/6 J wild-type ones. In contrast, Fmr1-KO animals did not show such an alteration but displayed abnormal morphology of TH-positive axons in the striatum with higher “complexity” and lower “texture”. Both strains exhibited decreased expression of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and increased spatial coupling between vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1, a label for glutamatergic terminals) and TH signals, while GABAergic neurons quantified by glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) remained intact. Intranasal administration of DA rescued the deficits in non-selective attention, object-based attention and social approaching of BTBR mice, likely by enhancing the level of TH in the striatum. Application of intranasal DA to Fmr1-KO animals alleviated their impairment of social novelty, in association with reduced striatal TH protein. These results suggest that although the DA system is modified differently in the two ASD models, intranasal treatment with DA effectively rectifies their behavioral phenotypes, which may present a promising therapy for diverse types of ASD.","c(""Autism"", ""Fragile X sy drome"", ""BTBR"", ""Fmr1"", ""Striatum"", ""Social behavior"")","c(""Joseph P.

Multiple ASD-associated mutations have been identified in the Shank family of proteins that play a critical role in the structure and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses, leading to impaired synapse function and the presentation of ASD-associated behavioural deficits in mice. Shank proteins are highly regulated by zinc, where zinc binds the Shank SAM domain to drive synaptic protein recruitment and synaptic maturation. Here we have examined the influence of maternal dietary zinc supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the development of ASD-associated behavioural and synaptic changes in the offspring Shank3 knockout (Shank3−/−) mice. Behavioural and electrophysiological experiments were performed in juvenile and adult Shank3−/− and wildtype littermate control mice born from mothers fed control (30 ppm, ppm) or supplemented (150 ppm) dietary zinc. We observed that the supplemented maternal zinc diet prevented ASD-associated deficits in social interaction and normalised anxiety behaviours in Shank3−/− offspring mice. These effects were maintained into adulthood. Repetitive grooming was also prevented in adult Shank3−/− offspring mice. At the synaptic level, maternal zinc supplementation altered postsynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated currents and presynaptic function at glutamatergic synapses onto medium spiny neurons in the cortico-striatal pathway of the Shank3−/− offspring mice. These data show that increased maternal dietary zinc during pregnancy and lactation can alter the development of ASD-associated changes at the synaptic and the behavioural levels, and that zinc supplementation from the beginning of brain development can prevent ASD-associated deficits in Shank3−/− mice long term.","c(""Autism"", ""Zi c"", ""Sha k3"", ""Mater al diet"", ""Glutamate"", ""Sy apse"")","Johanna M.

To address this issue, we crossed the Leprflox/flox mice with each of Shh-Cre mice (Shh, sonic hedgehog) and Nestin (Nes)-Cre mice. We found that deletion of Lepr specifically in nestin-expressing cells led to extreme obesity, but the conditional null of Lepr in Shh-expressing cells had no obvious phenotype.

In the CTA, consumption of an appetitive tastant is associated with aversive experience such as visceral malaise, which results in avoidance of consuming a learned tastant. Previously, we showed that levels of the cyclic-AMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) determine the insular cortical neurons that proceed to encode a conditioned taste memory. In the amygdala and hippocampus, it is shown that CREB and neuronal activity regulate memory allocation and the neuronal mechanism that determines the specific neurons in a neural network that will store a given memory. However, cellular mechanism of memory allocation in the insular cortex is not fully understood. In the current study, we manipulated the neuronal activity in a subset of insular cortical and/or basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons in mice, at the time of learning; for this purpose, we used an hM3Dq designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug system (DREADD). Subsequently, we examined whether the neuronal population whose activity is increased during learning, is reactivated by memory retrieval, using the expression of immediate early gene c-fos. When an hM3Dq receptor was activated only in a subset of IC neurons, c-fos expression following memory retrieval was not significantly observed in hM3Dq-positive neurons. Interestingly, the probability of c-fos expression in hM3Dq-positive IC neurons after retrieval was significantly increased when the IC and BLA were co-activated during conditioning.

Here, we first located a GBA eQTL, rs12411216, by analysing DHS, eQTL SNP, and transcription factor binding site data using the UCSC database. Subsequently, we found that rs12411216 was significantly associated with PD-MCI (P < 0.05) in 306 PD patients by genotyping. In exploring the relationship between rs12411216 and GBA expression, the SNP was found to be associated with GBA expression in 50 PD patients through qPCR verification. In a further CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing module, the SNP was identified to cause a decrease in GBA expression, weaken enzymatic activity and enhance the abnormal aggregation of α-Syn in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we confirmed that the binding efficiency of transcription factor E2F4 was affected by the rs12411216 SNP. In conclusion, our results showed that rs12411216 regulated GBA expression, supporting its potential role as a PD-MCI genetic biomarker and highlighting novel mechanisms underlying Parkinson’s disease.","c("" GBA "", ""rs12411216"", ""α-Sy uclei "", ""Parki so ’s disease-mild cog itive impairme t"")","c(""Zhihong Shi"", ""Yuhu Zhang"", ""Fei Ling"")","""shzhh1204@126.om"", ""yhzhangsd@126.om"", ""fling@sut.edu.n""","08 July 2020"

We developed this system by splitting Cre recombinase into two fragments with evolved split inteins and subsequently expressed one fragment under the influence of a cell type-specific promoter in a transgenic animal, and delivered the other fragment via retrograde viral gene transfer. This approach results in the reconstitution of Cre recombinase in only specific population of neurons projecting from a specific brain region or in those of a specific neuronal type.

Sheets"")","https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00638-w","Cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying how chronic pain induces maladaptive alterations to local circuits in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), while emerging, remain unresolved. Consistent evidence shows that chronic pain attenuates activity in the prelimbic (PL) cortex, a mPFC subregion. This reduced activity is thought to be driven by increased inhibitory tone within PL circuits. Enhanced input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to inhibitory neurons in PL cortex is one well-received mechanism for this circuit change. In mice, we used retrograde labeling, brain slice recordings, and optogenetics to selectively stimulate and record ascending BLA inputs onto PL neurons that send projections to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is a midbrain structure that plays a significant role in endogenous analgesia. Activating BLA projections evoked both excitatory and inhibitory currents in cortico-PAG (CP) neurons, as we have shown previously. We measured changes to the ratio of BLA-evoked excitatory to inhibitory currents in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain. Our analysis reveals a reduced excitation-inhibition (E/I) ratio of BLA inputs to PL-CP neurons 7 days after SNI. The E/I ratio of BLA inputs to CP neurons in neighboring infralimbic (IL) cortex was unchanged in SNI animals. Collectively, this study reveals that the overall E/I balance of BLA inputs to PL neurons projecting to the PAG is reduced in a robust neuropathic pain model. Overall, our findings provide new mechanistic insight into how nerve injury produces dysfunction in PL circuits connected to structures involved in pain modulation.","list()","Patrick L.

Similarly, ligands of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) were shown to alter anxiety level. The 5-HT1A and 2A receptors are widely expressed across the brain, but the target region(s) underlying the influence of those receptors on anxiety remain unknown. Interestingly, recent studies in human and non-human primates have shown that the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A binding potentials within the insular cortex (insula) are correlated to anxiety. As an initial step to define the function of 5-HT transmission in the insula, we quantified the proportion of specific neuronal populations of the insula expressing 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A. We analyzed seven neural populations, including three defined by a molecular marker (putative glutamate, GABA or parvalbumin), and four defined by their projections to different downstream targets. First, we found that more than 70% of putative glutamatergic neurons, and only 30% of GABAergic neurons express the 5-HT1A. Second, within insular projection neurons, 5-HT1A is highly expressed (75–80%) in the populations targeting one sub-nuclei of the amygdala (central or basolateral), or targeting the rostral or caudal sections of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Similarly, 70% of putative glutamatergic neurons and only 30% of insular GABAergic neurons contain 5-HT2A. Finally, the 5-HT2A is present in a majority of insula-amygdala and insula-LH projection neurons (73–82%). These observations suggest that most glutamatergic neurons can respond to 5-HT through 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A in the insula, and that 5-HT directly affects a limited number of GABAergic neurons. This study defines a molecular and neuroanatomical map of the 5-HT system within the insular cortex, providing ground knowledge to identify the potential role of serotonergic modulation of selective insular populations in anxiety.","c(""Neural circuit"", ""A xiety"", ""Immu ohistochemistry"", ""Retrograde traci g"", ""Neuroa atomy"", ""Excitatory euro s"", ""I hibitory euro s"", ""Projectio euro s"", ""Sy aptophysi "")","Anna Beyeler","anna.beyeler@inserm.fr","29 June 2020"

We investigated ketamine’s effects on in vivo dorsal hippocampal (dHPC) synaptic plasticity and their role in mediating aspects of antidepressant activity in the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) model of depression. dHPC long-term potentiation (LTP) was significantly impaired in WKY rats compared to Wistar controls. Importantly, a single low dose (5 mg/kg, ip) of ketamine or its metabolite, (2R,6R)-HNK, rescued the LTP deficit in WKY rats at 3.5 h but not 30 min following injection, with residual effects at 24 h, indicating a delayed, sustained facilitatory effect on dHPC synaptic plasticity. Consistent with the observed dHPC LTP deficit, WKY rats exhibited impaired hippocampal-dependent long-term spatial memory as measured by the novel object location recognition test (NOLRT), which was effectively restored by pre-treatment with both ketamine or (2R,6R)-HNK. In contrast, in WKYs, which display abnormal stress coping, ketamine, but not (2R,6R)-HNK, had rapid and sustained effects in the forced swim test (FST), a commonly used preclinical screen for antidepressant-like activity. The differential effects of (2R,6R)-HNK observed here reveal a dissociation between drug effects on FST immobility and dHPC synaptic plasticity. Therefore, in the WKY rat model, restoring dHPC LTP was not correlated with ketamine’s effects in FST, but importantly, may have contributed to the reversal of hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits, which are critical features of clinical depression. Our findings support the theory that ketamine may reverse the stress-induced loss of connectivity in key neural circuits by engaging synaptic plasticity processes to “reset the system”.","c(""Ketami e"", ""Sy aptic plasticity"", ""LTP"", ""Hippocampus"", ""HNK"", ""A tidepressa t"", ""Memory a d cog itio "", ""Wistar-Kyoto rat"", ""Model of depressio "")","Yu Tian Wang","ytwang@brain.ub.a","16 June 2020"

Cx3cr1CreERT2 mice express Cre recombinase in a tamoxifen-inducible manner and have been widely used to delete target genes in microglia, since microglia are long-lived cells and outlive peripheral macrophages, which continuously turn over and lose their gene modification over time.

To study the role of ATG7 in adult microglia, we generated Cx3cr1CreERT2:Atg7fl/fl mice and deleted Atg7 at the age of 8 weeks, and found induction of intestinal adhesion. Since intestinal adhesion is caused by excessive inflammation, these results suggest that deletion of Atg7 in intestinal macrophages even for a short time results in inflammation that cannot be rescued by replenishment with wild-type intestinal macrophages.

Similarly, loss of DOT1L affected localization but not generation of dI2, dI3, dI5, V0 and V1 interneurons. The resulting derailed interneuron patterns might be responsible for increased cell death, occurrence of which was restricted to the late developmental stage E18.5.

To address this question, we asked whether chronic treatment with clozapine can induce obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)-like behavior in mice.

Imbalanced neuronal activity between striosomes and matrix is implicated in neurological deficits in psychomotor and limbic functions. Because patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are impaired in social communication and psychomotor function, it raises the possibility that abnormal striatal compartments may contribute to ASD pathogenesis. Here, we provide pathological evidence from human postmortem brains to support this hypothesis. Because ASD is a neurodevelopmental disease that emerges early in childhood, we analyzed juvenile and adolescent brains. Distinct patterns of PRODYNORPHIN-positive and calbindin-poor striosomes were detected in the caudate nucleus of control brains by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. By contrast, PRODYNORPHIN-positive and calbindin-poor striosomes were decreased in the caudate nucleus of young ASD brains. Moreover, calbindin, a matrix marker, was aberrantly increased in the striosomal compartment, obscuring the boundaries between calbindin-poor striosomes and calbindin-rich matrix in ASD caudate nucleus. Calbindin-positive cells were decreased in the ASD matrix compartment. Collectively, our study has uncovered for the first time that aberrant striatal compartments occur in the caudate nucleus of human ASD brains, which suggests abnormal striatal compartmentation as a pathological signature that has previously been underestimated in ASD pathogenesis.","c(""Basal ga glia"", ""Striatum"", ""Caudate ucleus"", ""Striosome"", ""Autism"")","Fu-Chin Liu","fuhin@ym.edu.tw","27 May 2020"

Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor for glaucoma and recent work has demonstrated critical early neuroinflammatory insults occur in the optic nerve head following ocular hypertension. Microglia and infiltrating monocytes are likely candidates to drive these neuroinflammatory insults. However, the exact molecular identity / transcriptomic profile of microglia following ocular hypertensive insults is unknown. To elucidate the molecular identity of microglia after long-term exposure to ocular hypertension, we used a mouse model of glaucoma (DBA/2 J). We performed RNA-sequencing of microglia mRNA from the optic nerve head at a time point following ocular hypertensive insults, but preceding detectable neurodegeneration (with microglia identified as being CD45lo/CD11b+/CD11c−). Furthermore, RNA-sequencing was performed on optic nerve head microglia from mice treated with radiation therapy, a potent therapy preventing neuroinflammatory insults. Transcriptomic profiling of optic nerve head microglia mRNA identifies metabolic priming with marked changes in mitochondrial gene expression, and changes to phagocytosis, inflammatory, and sensome pathways. The data predict that many functions of microglia that help maintain tissue homeostasis are affected. Comparative analysis of these data with data from previously published whole optic nerve head tissue or monocyte-only samples from DBA/2 J mice demonstrate that many of the neuroinflammatory signatures in these data sets arise from infiltrating monocytes and not reactive microglia. Finally, our data demonstrate that prophylactic radiation therapy of DBA/2 J mice potently abolishes these microglia metabolic transcriptomic changes at the same time points. Together, our data provide a unique resource for the community to help drive further hypothesis generation and testing in glaucoma.","c(""Glaucoma"", ""Optic erve head"", ""Microglia"", ""RNA-seque ci g"", ""DBA/2 J"", ""Neuroi flammatio "", ""Mitocho dria"")","c(""Pete A.

We investigated the effects of Son knockdown on neural development in mice and found that Son knockdown in neural progenitors resulted in defective migration during corticogenesis and reduced spine density on mature cortical neurons. The induction of human wild-type SON expression rescued these neural abnormalities, confirming that the abnormalities were caused by SON insufficiency. We also applied truncated SON proteins encoded by disease-associated mutant SON genes for rescue experiments and found that a truncated SON protein encoded by the most prevalent SON mutant found in ZTTK syndrome rescued the neural abnormalities while another much shorter mutant SON protein did not.

Here we present a two-compartment model of the synapse in which the presynaptic terminal first acts to filter presynaptic input before the postsynaptic terminal, acting as a gain controller, amplifies or depresses transmission. We argue that both compartments are equipped with distinct plasticity rules to enable them to optimally adapt synaptic transmission to the statistics of pre- and postsynaptic activity.

The majority of FUS mutations are missense mutations affecting the nuclear localisation signal (NLS) of FUS. In addition, a number of frameshift mutations which result in complete NLS deletion have been described. Patients bearing frameshift mutations usually present with more aggressive disease, characterised by an early onset and rapid progression. Both missense mutations in the NLS coding sequence and complete loss of the NLS are known to result in cytoplasmic mislocalisation of FUS protein. However, in addition to the removal of FUS functional domains, frameshift mutations in most cases lead to the attachment of a “tail” of novel amino acids at the FUS C-terminus – a frameshift peptide. It is not clear whether these peptide tails would affect the properties of truncated FUS proteins. In the current study, we compared intracellular behaviour of disease-associated truncated FUS proteins with and without the corresponding frameshift peptides. We demonstrate that some of these peptides can affect subcellular distribution and/or increase aggregation capacity and stability of the truncated FUS protein.

However, the pathophysiology of the gene mutations is far from clear. Here we report a novel SLC6A1 missense mutation in a patient with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder and characterized the molecular defects of the mutant GAT-1, from transporter protein trafficking to GABA uptake function in heterologous cells and neurons. The heterozygous missense mutation (c1081C to A (P361T)) in SLC6A1 was identified by exome sequencing. We have thoroughly characterized the molecular pathophysiology underlying the clinical phenotypes. We performed EEG recordings and autism diagnostic interview. The patient had neurodevelopmental delay, absence epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, and 2.5–3 Hz generalized spike and slow waves on EEG recordings. The impact of the mutation on GAT-1 function and trafficking was evaluated by 3H GABA uptake, structural simulation with machine learning tools, live cell confocal microscopy and protein expression in mouse neurons and nonneuronal cells. We demonstrated that the GAT-1(P361T) mutation destabilizes the global protein conformation and reduces total protein expression. The mutant transporter protein was localized intracellularly inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with a pattern of expression very similar to the cells treated with tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer. Radioactive 3H-labeled GABA uptake assay indicated the mutation reduced the function of the mutant GAT-1(P361T), to a level that is similar to the cells treated with GAT-1 inhibitors. In summary, this mutation destabilizes the mutant transporter protein, which results in retention of the mutant protein inside cells and reduction of total transporter expression, likely via excessive endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation. This thus likely causes reduced functional transporter number on the cell surface, which then could cause the observed reduced GABA uptake function. Consequently, malfunctioning GABA signaling may cause altered neurodevelopment and neurotransmission, such as enhanced tonic inhibition and altered cell proliferation in vivo. The pathophysiology due to severely impaired GAT-1 function may give rise to a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes including autism and epilepsy.","c(""E doplasmic reticulum"", ""Degradatio "", ""Mutatio "", ""GABA tra sporter 1"", ""Protei stability"", ""3H GABA uptake"", ""Autism"", ""Epilepsy"")","Jing-Qiong Kang","Jingqiong.kang@vanderbilt.edu","12 May 2020"

However, the presence in genomes of the studied mouse lines of additional genetic modifications that affect expression of genes located in a close proximity to the alpha-synuclein-encoding Snca gene makes these data open to various interpretations. To unambiguously demonstrate that the absence of alpha-synuclein is the primary cause of the observed deficit of dopaminergic neurons, we employed a recently produced constituent alpha-synuclein knockout mouse line B6(Cg)-Sncatm1.2Vlb/J. The only modification introduced to the genome of these mice is a substitution of the first coding exon and adjusted short intronic fragments of the Snca gene by a single loxP site. We compared the number of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc of this line, previously studied B6(Cg)-Sncatm1Rosl/J line and wild type littermate mice. A similar decrease was observed in both knockout lines when compared with wild type mice. In a recently published study we revealed no loss of dopaminergic neurons following conditional inactivation of the Snca gene in neurons of adult mice.

Indeed, soluble ST2 is reported to reduce IL-33-induced IL-6 and TNF-α production in macrophages and IL-33-induced IL-5 and IL-13 production in type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Elevated serum concentrations of soluble ST2 have been reported in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting pathophysiological roles of soluble ST2 in behavioral phenotypes. Nevertheless, the relation between soluble ST2 and depressive behavior remain to be uncovered. To complement this point, we performed broad behavioral phenotyping, utilizing transgenic mice with a high concentration of serum ST2 in the present study. Soluble ST2 overexpression mice (ST2 Tg mice) were generated on a C3H/HeJ background. ST2 Tg mice crossed onto the BALB/c genetic background were used. Before starting tests, each mouse was observed in a clean cage for a general health check and neurological screening tests. In Experiment I, comprehensive behavioral phenotyping was performed to reveal the role of soluble ST2 on sensorimotor functions, anxiety-like behaviors, depression-like behaviors, social behaviors, and learning and memory functions. In Experiment II, to confirm the role of soluble ST2 on depression-like behaviors, a depression test battery (two bottle choice test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test) was applied. The general health check indicated good general health and normal gross appearance for ST2 Tg mice. Further, the neurological reflexes of all the mice were normal. We found that soluble ST2 overexpression resulted in decreased social interaction. Moreover, depression-like behaviors of ST2 Tg mice were observed in two well-established behavioral paradigms, the forced swimming test and the tail suspension test. Nevertheless, hedonic reaction to sucrose was observed in ST2 Tg mice similar to WT mice. These results suggest the depression in the ST2 Tg mice.

Feedforward inhibition driven by the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) has been previously observed, but its physiological function and regulation remain unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that elevated neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex is required for the short-term storage of information. Furthermore, the elevated neuronal activity is supported by the reciprocal connectivity between the MD and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Therefore, detailed knowledge about the synaptic connections during high-frequency activity is critical for understanding the mechanism of short-term memory. In this study, we examined how feedforward inhibition of thalamofrontal connectivity is modulated by activity frequency. We observed greater short-term synaptic depression during disynaptic inhibition than in thalamic excitatory synapses during high-frequency activities. The strength of feedforward inhibition became weaker as the stimulation continued, which, in turn, enhanced the range of firing jitter in a frequency-dependent manner. We postulated that this phenomenon was primarily due to the increased failure rate of evoking action potentials in parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons. These findings suggest that the MD-mPFC pathway is dynamically regulated by an excitatory-inhibitory balance in an activity-dependent manner. During low-frequency activities, excessive excitations are inhibited, and firing is restricted to a limited temporal range by the strong feedforward inhibition. However, during high-frequency activities, such as during short-term memory, the activity can be transferred in a broader temporal range due to the decreased feedforward inhibition.","c(""Thalamofro tal"", ""Feedforward i hibitio "", ""Mediodorsal ucleus of the thalamus"", ""Dorsal a terior ci gulate cortex"", ""Short-term memory"")","Jong-Cheol Rah","jrah@kbri.re.kr","06 May 2020"

AZ7235, a previously discovered Axl kinase inhibitor, was identified to have robust apoE activity in brain microglia, astrocytes and pericytes. AZ7235 also increased expression of ATP-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1), which is involved in the lipidation and secretion of apoE. Moreover, AZ7235 did not exhibit Liver-X-Receptor (LXR) activity and stimulated apoE and ABCA1 expression in the absence of LXR. Target validation studies using AXL−/− CCF-STTG1 cells showed that Axl is required to mediate AZ7235 upregulation of apoE and ABCA1. Intriguingly, apoE expression and secretion was significantly attenuated in AXL-deficient CCF-STTG1 cells and reconstitution of Axl or kinase-dead Axl significantly restored apoE baseline levels, demonstrating that Axl also plays a role in maintaining apoE homeostasis in astrocytes independent of its kinase activity. Lastly, these effects may require human apoE regulatory sequences, as AZ7235 exhibited little stimulatory activity toward apoE and ABCA1 in primary murine glia derived from neonatal human APOE3 targeted-replacement mice. Collectively, we identified a small molecule that exhibits robust apoE and ABCA1 activity independent of the LXR pathway in human cells and elucidated a novel relationship between Axl and apoE homeostasis in human astrocytes.","c(""Apolipoprotei E"", ""AXL"", ""Astrocyte"", ""Alzheimer’s disease"")","Cheryl L.

However, the mechanisms underlying the development of cortical interneurons remain unclear. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) has been shown to be involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation and migration, and plays an important role in the neurogenesis of cortical excitatory neurons. However, the function of PDK1 in interneurons is still unclear. Here, we reported that the disruption of Pdk1 in the subpallium achieved by crossing the Dlx5/6-Cre-IRES-EGFP line with Pdk1fl/fl mice led to the severely increased apoptosis of immature interneurons, subsequently resulting in a remarkable reduction in cortical interneurons. However, the tangential migration, progenitor pools and cell proliferation were not affected by the disruption of Pdk1. We further found the activity of AKT-GSK3β signaling pathway was decreased after Pdk1 deletion, suggesting it might be involved in the regulation of the survival of cortical interneurons.

TRPM8 is a cold and menthol-sensitive channel found in a subset of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors. Deletion or inhibition of the TRPM8 channel was found to prevent the cold hyperalgesia induced by chronic administration of morphine. Here, we examined the mechanisms by which morphine was able to promote cold hypersensitivity in DRG neurons and transfected HEK cells. Mice daily injected with morphine for 5 days developed cold hyperalgesia. Treatment with morphine did not alter the expressions of cold sensitive TREK-1, TRAAK and TRPM8 in DRGs. However, TRPM8-expressing DRG neurons isolated from morphine-treated mice exhibited hyperexcitability. Sustained morphine treatment in vitro sensitized TRPM8 responsiveness to cold or menthol and reduced activation-evoked desensitization of the channel. Blocking phospholipase C (PLC) as well as protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), but not protein kinase A (PKA) or Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), restored channel desensitization. Identification of two PKC phosphorylation consensus sites, S1040 and S1041, in the TRPM8 and their site-directed mutation were able to prevent the MOR-induced reduction in TRPM8 desensitization. Our results show that activation of MOR by morphine 1) promotes hyperexcitability of TRPM8-expressing neurons and 2) induces a PKCβ-mediated reduction of TRPM8 desensitization. This MOR-PKCβ dependent modulation of TRPM8 may underlie the onset of cold hyperalgesia caused by repeated administration of morphine.

The zona incerta is a subthalamic nucleus in which the A13 dopaminergic cell group resides, but how this A13 group affects nociceptive processing remains unknown. Recently, we showed that acute nociceptive stimuli rapidly induce the activity of A10 (ventral tegmental area) dopamine neurons via fiber photometry. In this study, we measured the activity of A13 dopaminergic neurons in response to acute nociceptive stimuli using the same system. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV-CAG-FLEX-G-CaMP6 and AAV-CAG-FLEX-mCherry) were unilaterally injected into the A13 site in transgenic mice carrying a dopamine transporter promotor-regulated Cre recombinase transgene to specifically introduce G-CaMP6/mCherry into A13 dopaminergic cell bodies through site-specific infection. We measured G-CaMP6/mCherry fluorescence intensity in the A13 site to acute nociceptive stimuli (pinch stimulus and heat stimulus). These stimuli significantly induced a rapid increase in G-CaMP6 fluorescence intensity, but non-nociceptive control stimuli did not. In contrast, mCherry fluorescence intensity was not significantly changed by nociceptive stimuli or non-nociceptive stimuli. Our finding is the first report to measure the activity of A13 dopaminergic neurons to aversive stimuli. A13 dopaminergic neurons project to the periaqueductal gray and the central nucleus of the amygdala, which are both well known as key regions in nociceptive processing.

In studying approaches to mitigate this calcium overload, we identified the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), an axonal guidance protein that participates in synapse dynamics by interacting with and regulating activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We further identified a 15 amino acid peptide from CRMP2 (designated CBD3, for calcium-binding domain 3), that reduced NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx in cultured neurons and post-synaptic NMDAR-mediated currents in cortical slices. Whether targeting CRMP2 could be therapeutically beneficial in AD is unknown. Here, using CBD3, we tested the utility of this approach. Employing the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD which demonstrates robust pathophysiology including Aβ1–42 deposition, altered tau levels, and diminished cognitive functions, we asked if overexpression of CBD3 could rescue these events. CBD3 was engineered into an adeno-associated vector and nasally delivered into APP/PS1 mice and then biochemical (immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting), cellular (TUNEL apoptosis assays), and behavioral (Morris water maze test) assessments were performed.

However, its long-term dynamic transcriptional changes remain poorly understood. It is also unknown whether this neuroinflammation contributes to the recovery or just deteriorates the outcome. The purpose of this study is to characterize the temporal transcriptional changes in the post-stroke brain focusing on DAMPs-related genes by RNA-sequencing during the period of 28 days. We conducted the RNA-sequencing on day 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 post-stroke in the mouse photothrombosis model. The gross morphological observation showed the ischemic lesion on the ipsilateral cortex turned into a scar with the clearance of cellular debris by day 28. The transcriptome analyses indicated that post-stroke period of 28 days was classified into four categories (I Baseline, II Acute, III Sub-acute-#1, IV Sub-acute-#2 phase). During this period, the well-known genes for DAMPs, receptors, downstream cascades, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and phagocytosis were transcriptionally increased. The gene ontology (GO) analysis of biological process indicated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are genetically programmed to achieve immune and inflammatory pathways. Interestingly, we found the biphasic induction of various genes, including DAMPs and pro-inflammatory factors, peaking at acute and sub-acute phases. At the sub-acute phase, we also observed the induction of genes for phagocytosis as well as regulatory and growth factors. Further, we found the activation of CREB (cAMP-response element binding protein), one of the key players for neuronal plasticity, in peri-ischemic neurons by immunohistochemistry at this phase.

In contrast, deletion of DCC from CA3 neurons did not induce detectable changes in the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons, but impaired performance on the novel object place recognition task as well as compromised excitatory synaptic transmission and LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses.

This book introduced the concepts of the “Hebb synapse”, the “Hebbian cell assembly” and the “Phase sequence”. The most frequently cited of these is the Hebb synapse, but the cell assembly may be Hebb’s most important contribution. Even after 70 years, Hebb’s theory is still relevant because it is a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the development of neural networks. The Organization of Behavior was Hebb’s 40th publication. His first published papers in 1937 were on the innate organization of the visual system and he first used the phrase “the organization of behavior” in 1938. However, Hebb wrote a number of unpublished papers between 1932 and 1945 in which he developed the ideas published in The Organization of Behavior. Thus, the concept of the neural organization of behavior was central to Hebb’s thinking from the beginning of his academic career. But his thinking about the organization of behavior in 1949 was different from what it was between 1932 and 1937. This paper examines Hebb’s early ideas on the neural basis of behavior and attempts to trace the rather arduous series of steps through which he developed these ideas into the book that was published as The Organization of Behavior. Using the 1946 typescript and Hebb’s correspondence we can see a number of changes made in the book before it was published. Finally, a number of issues arising from the book, and the importance of the book today are discussed.","list()","Richard E. Brown","rebrown@dal.a","06 April 2020"

CaMKII associates with multiple proteins located at or near the postsynaptic density (PSD), and CaMKII is known to translocate from cytoplasm to PSD under excitatory conditions. The present study examined the laminar distribution of CaMKII at the PSD by immunogold labeling in dissociated hippocampal cultures under low calcium (EGTA or APV), control, and stimulated (depolarization with high K+ or NMDA) conditions. The patterns of CaMKII distribution are classified with particular reference to the two layers of the PSD: (1) the PSD core, a layer within ~ 30–40 nm to the postsynaptic membrane, and (2) the PSD pallium, a deeper layer beyond the PSD core, ~ 100–120 nm from the postsynaptic membrane. Under low calcium conditions, a subpopulation (40%) of synapses stood out with no CaMKII labeling at the PSD, indicating that localization of CaMKII at the PSD is sensitive to calcium levels. Under control conditions, the majority (~ 60–70%) of synapses had label for CaMKII dispersed evenly in the spine, including the PSD and the nearby cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, the majority (60–75%) of synapses had label for CaMKII concentrated at the PSD, delineating the PSD pallium from the cytoplasm. Median distance of label for CaMKII to postsynaptic membrane was higher in low calcium samples (68–77 nm), than in control (59–63 nm) and stimulated samples (49–53 nm). Thus, upon stimulation, not only more CaMKII translocated to the PSD, but they also were closer to the postsynaptic membrane. Additionally, there were two relatively infrequent labeling patterns that may represent intermediate stages of CaMKII distribution between basal and stimulated conditions: (1) one type showed label preferentially localized near the PSD core where CaMKII may be binding to NR2B, an NMDA receptor concentrated at the PSD core, and (2) the second type showed label preferentially in the PSD pallium, where CaMKII may be binding to Shank, a PSD scaffold protein located in the PSD pallium. Both of these distribution patterns may portray the initial stages of CaMKII translocation upon synaptic activation. In addition to binding to PSD proteins, the concentrated CaMKII labeling at the PSD under heightened excitatory conditions could also be formed by self-clustering of CaMKII molecules recruited to the PSD. Most importantly, these accumulated CaMKII molecules do not extend beyond the border of the PSD pallium, and are likely held in the pallium by binding to Shank under these conditions.","c(""Electro microscopy"", ""Immu ogold labeli g"", ""CaMKII"", ""PSD"", ""Sha k"")","Jung-Hwa Tao-Cheng","hengs@ninds.nih.gov","01 April 2020"

In this study, we focused on the role of miR-326 and its target gene δ-opioid receptor (DOR) in the pathogenesis of neonatal HIBD. The expression levels of miR-326 and DOR after hypoxic-ischemic injury were examined both in vivo and in vitro. The direct relationship between miR-326 and DOR was confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Further, effects of miR-326 on cell viability and apoptosis levels under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) were analyzed. The expression levels of miR-326 were significantly lower and DOR levels were significantly higher in the HIBD group than the control group both in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of miR-326 downregulated the expression of DOR, while suppression of miR-326 upregulated the expression of DOR. The dual-luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that DOR could be directly targeted and regulated by miR-326. MiR-326 knockdown improved cell survival and decreased cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax and increasing Bcl-2 expression in PC12 cells after exposure to OGD.

In the present study, we established the BCP model by implantation of Walker 256 carcinoma cells into rats’ tibial medullary cavity and performed transcriptome sequencing of the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord to explore changes in expression profiles of lncRNA and mRNA. We identified 1220 differently expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) (1171 up-regulated and 49 down-regulated) and 323 differently expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) (246 up-regulated and 77 down-regulated) in BCP model, among which 10 DEmRNAs (5 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated) and 10 DElncRNAs (5 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated) were validated the expression by RT-qPCR. Then, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis on the expression of DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs, showing that they were mainly enriched in inflammatory and immunologic processes/pathways. Finally, we constructed a co-expression network and a ceRNA network of DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs to exhibit a potential regulatory mechanism of DElncRNAs, directly regulating protein coding gene expression in cis or in trans and indirectly regulating protein coding gene expression by sponging miRNA.

Trans-synaptic tracing with neurotropic viruses has become one of the most effective technologies to dissect the neural circuits. Although the retrograde trans-synaptic tracing for analyzing the input neural networks with recombinant rabies and pseudorabies virus has been broadly applied in neuroscience, viral tools for analyzing the output neural networks are still lacking. The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been used for the mapping of synaptic outputs. However, several drawbacks, including high neurotoxicity and rapid lethality in experimental animals, hinder its application in long-term studies of the structure and function of neural networks. To overcome these limitations, we generated a recombinant VSV with replication-related N gene mutation, VSV-NR7A, and examined its cytotoxicity and efficiency of trans-synaptic spreading. We found that by comparison with the wild-type tracer of VSV, the NR7A mutation endowed the virus lower rate of propagation and cytotoxicity in vitro, as well as significantly reduced neural inflammatory responses in vivo and much longer animal survival when it was injected into the nucleus of the mice brain. Besides, the spreading of the attenuated VSV was delayed when injected into the VTA. Importantly, with the reduced toxicity and extended animal survival, the number of brain regions that was trans-synaptically labeled by the mutant VSV was more than that of the wild-type VSV. These results indicated that the VSV-NR7A, could be a promising anterograde tracer that enables researchers to explore more downstream connections of a given brain region, and observe the anatomical structure and the function of the downstream circuits over a longer time window.

Here we show that targeted deletion of β1-syntrophin leads to a partial loss of AQP4 from perivascular Müller cell endfeet and that a concomitant deletion of both α1- and β1-syntrophin causes a near complete loss of AQP4 from both perivascular and subvitreal endfoot membranes. α1-syntrophin is normally very weakly expressed in Müller cell endfeet but β1-syntrophin knockout mice display an increased amount of α1-syntrophin at these sites.

Whether and to what degree LTP induction also enhances presynaptic glutamate release has been the subject of debate. Here, we took advantage of the recently developed genetically encoded optical sensors of glutamate (iGluSnFR) to monitor its release at CA3-CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices, before and after the induction of LTP. We attempted to trace release events at multiple synapses simultaneously, by using two-photon excitation imaging in fast frame-scanning mode. We thus detected a significant increase in the average iGluSnFR signal during potentiation, which lasted for up to 90 min.

Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies have shown that CGRP and its receptors are expressed in cortical areas that are critical for pain perception including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insular cortex (IC). Recent studies reported that CGRP enhanced excitatory transmission in the ACC. However, little is known about the possible effect of CGRP on excitatory transmission in the IC. In the present study, we investigated the role of CGRP on synaptic transmission in the IC slices of adult male mice. Bath application of CGRP produced dose-dependent potentiation of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs). This potentiation was NMDA receptor (NMDAR) independent. After application of CGRP1 receptor antagonist CGRP8–37 or BIBN 4096, CGRP produced potentiation was significantly reduced. Paired-pulse facilitation was significantly decreased by CGRP, suggesting possible presynaptic mechanisms. Consistently, bath application of CGRP significantly increased the frequency of spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and mEPSCs). By contrast, amplitudes of sEPSCs and mEPSCs were not significantly affected. Finally, adenylyl cyclase subtype 1 (AC1) and protein kinase A (PKA) are critical for CGRP-produced potentiation, since both selective AC1 inhibitor NB001 and the PKA inhibitor KT5720 completely blocked the potentiation. Our results provide direct evidence that CGRP contributes to synaptic potentiation in the IC, and the AC1 inhibitor NB001 may be beneficial for the treatment of migraine in the future.","c(""Calcito i ge e-related peptide"", ""I sular cortex"", ""Sy aptic tra smissio "", ""Ade ylyl cyclase subtype 1"")","Min Zhuo","min.zhuo@utoronto.a","09 March 2020"

Hence, the steadily rise in preterm birth and cesarean section (CS) delivery rates over the past years has become a worldwide health concern. In our previous work, we reported that even though no long-term autistic-like deficits were observed, mice born preterm by CS presented early transient neuronal and communicative defects. However, understanding if these alterations were due to an early birth combined with CS delivery, or if prematurity solely could lead to a similar outcome remained to be evaluated. Using mice born either at term or preterm by vaginal or CS delivery, we assessed early life ultrasonic vocalizations and the onset of eye opening. We report that alterations in communicative behaviors are finely attuned and specifically affected either by preterm birth or by the association between CS delivery and preterm birth in mice, while delayed onset of eye opening is due to prematurity.

The presence of specific variants of GluN2 subunits in these complexes enables diversity in NMDA receptor function and regulation. At brain synapses, there is a switch from slow GluN2B-mediated NMDA receptors to faster GluN2A-dominated NMDA receptors as well as an increase in the ratio of AMPA to NMDA receptors during early postnatal development. This glutamate receptor switch is observed across brain regions and is critical for synaptic maturation, circuit development, and associative learning. However, whether a similar receptor subunit switch occurs within pain processing neurons in the developing spinal cord remains untested. To investigate this, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of excitatory synaptic responses from lamina II dorsal horn neurons of one to three week-old rats. We found that GluN2B and GluN2A both prominently contribute to NMDA receptor responses at neonatal lamina II synapses, with a small contribution from GluN2D as well. Surprisingly, we found that this molecular identity of NMDA receptor responses as well as the relative contribution of AMPA receptors versus NMDA receptors did not change at lamina II synapses across early postnatal development (P7 to P21). The lack of a developmental switch and persistence of slow-decaying GluN2B- and GluN2D-mediated synaptic responses throughout neuronal maturation in the dorsal horn has implications for understanding both the regulation of synaptic glutamatergic receptors as well as spinal mechanisms of pain processing.","c(""Spi al cord"", ""Dorsal hor "", ""Lami a II"", ""Sy apse"", ""NMDA receptor"", ""GluN2A"", ""GluN2B"", ""GluN2D"", ""AMPA receptor"", ""Developme t"")","Michael E.

A growing body of research work suggests that neuroinflammation plays important roles in the development of AD. Thus, considerable efforts are directed towards identification of compounds that can reduce or inhibit neuroinflammation. Here, we show that sinomenine, a compound present in a Chinese medicinal plant, Sinomenium acutum, inhibits oligomeric amyloid beta-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) and inflammation-related molecules from astrocytic cells. The conditioned medium from oligomeric amyloid beta-treated astrocytic cells induces cell death in the hippocampal neuronal cells. Importantly, sinomenine inhibits this cell death. In addition, this compound has inhibitory effects on the production of ROS, NO and inflammation-related factors from oligomeric amyloid-beta treated human astrocytes. Finally, the conditioned medium from oligomeric amyloid beta-treated human astrocytes induces cell death in the primary culture of human neurons, which is inhibited by sinomenine. Thus, sinomenine inhibits amyloid beta-induced production of toxic factors from astrocytes, and confers protection to hippocampal neuronal cells as well as human neurons against indirect toxicity. The results suggest that this compound could provide beneficial effects in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions by reducing inflammation and neuronal cell death.","c(""Alzheimer’s disease"", ""Amyloid beta"", ""Si ome i e"", ""Neurotoxicity"", ""Neuroi flammatio "")","Shiv Kumar Sharma","sharmas@nbr.a.in","04 March 2020"

TSK accumulated in nonprosensory regions during early embryonic stages and in both nonprosensory and prosensory regions in late embryonic stages. In adult mice, TSK was localized in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion cells, and the stria vascularis. Moreover, loss of TSK caused dynamic changes in the expression of key genes that drive the differentiation of the inner hair cells in prosensory regions. Finally, our results revealed that TSK interacted with Sox2 and BMP4 to control stereocilia formation in the inner hair cells.

We used a double transgenic mouse strain (Arl13b-mCherry; Centrin2-GFP), in which we found spontaneous seizures, and a cortical injury model to examine the morphological changes of astrocytic and neuronal primary cilia under reactive conditions. Transgenic overexpression of Arl13b drastically increases the length of astrocytic and neuronal primary cilia in the hippocampus, as well as the cilia lengths of cultured astrocytes and neurons. Spontaneous seizures shorten Arl13b-positive astrocytic cilia and AC3-positive neuronal cilia in the hippocampus. In a cortical injury model, Arl13b is not detectable in primary cilia, but Arl13b protein relocates to the cell body and has robust expression in the proximity of injured tissues. In contrast, the number of AC3-positive cilia near injured tissues remains unchanged, but their lengths become shorter. These results on astrocytic cilia implicate Arl13b in regulating astrocyte proliferation and tissue regeneration, while the shortening of AC3-positive cilia suggests adaptive changes of neuronal primary cilia under excitotoxicity.","c(""Primary cilia"", ""Astrocytes"", ""Arl13b"", ""AC3"", ""Traumatic brai i jury"", ""Epilepsy"")","Xuanmao Chen","Xuanmao.Chen@unh.edu","02 March 2020"

In this study, we examined mice engineered with a point mutation in the intronic editing complementary sequence (ECS) of the GluA2 gene, Gria2. Mice heterozygous for the ECS mutation (named GluA2+/ECS(G)) had a ~ 20% reduction in GluA2 RNA editing at the Q/R site. We conducted an initial phenotypic analysis of these mice, finding altered current-voltage relations (confirming expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors at the synapse). Anatomically, we observed a loss of hippocampal CA1 neurons, altered dendritic morphology and reductions in CA1 pyramidal cell spine density. Behaviourally, GluA2+/ECS(G) mice exhibited reduced motor coordination, and learning and memory impairments. Notably, the mice also exhibited both NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) and vulnerability to NMDA receptor-independent seizures. These NMDA receptor-independent seizures were rescued by the Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptor antagonist IEM-1460.

Although ligand (testosterone)-dependent mutant AR aggregation has been shown to play important roles in motor neuronal degeneration by the analyses of transgenic mice models and in vitro cell culture models, the underlying disease mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated because of the discrepancy between model mice and SBMA patients. Thus, novel human disease models that recapitulate SBMA patients’ pathology more accurately are required for more precise pathophysiological analysis and the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we established disease specific iPSCs from four SBMA patients, and differentiated them into spinal motor neurons. To investigate motor neuron specific pathology, we purified iPSC-derived motor neurons using flow cytometry and cell sorting based on the motor neuron specific reporter, HB9e438::Venus, and proceeded to the genome-wide transcriptome analysis by RNA sequences. The results revealed the involvement of the pathology associated with synapses, epigenetics, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in SBMA.

NMDARs are comprised of four subunits derived from heterogeneous subunit families, yielding a complex diversity in NMDAR form and function. The quadruply-liganded state of binding of two glutamate and two glycine molecules to the receptor drives channel gating, allowing for monovalent cation flux, Ca2+ entry and the initiation of Ca2+-dependent signalling. In addition to this ionotropic function, non-ionotropic signalling can be initiated through the exclusive binding of glycine or of glutamate to the NMDAR. This binding may trigger a transmembrane conformational change of the receptor, inducing intracellular protein-protein signalling between the cytoplasmic domain and secondary messengers. In this review, we outline signalling cascades that can be activated by NMDARs and propose that the receptor transduces signalling through three parallel streams: (i) signalling via both glycine and glutamate binding, (ii) signalling via glycine binding, and (iii) signalling via glutamate binding. This variety in signal transduction mechanisms and downstream signalling cascades complements the widespread prevalence and rich diversity of NMDAR activity throughout the central nervous system and in disease pathology.","c(""NMDA receptors"", ""Sy aptic plasticity"", ""Io otropic"", ""Metabotropic"", ""Sig alli g cascades"", ""Protei ki ases"")","Michael W.

In the present study, a significant upregulation of synaptic and non-synaptic BKCa channel accessory β4 subunits in the ACC was accompanied with pain-associated anxiety-like behaviors in the chronic compression of multiple dorsal root ganglia (mCCD) of the rat. NS1619, an opener of BKCa channels, significantly rescued the alteration of fAHP and AP duration of ACC pyramidal neurons in mCCD rats.

The goal of the current study was to address the hypothesis that Aβ can be transferred via extracellular vesicles (ECVs) from brain endothelial cells to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and that this process can contribute to abnormal NPC differentiation. Mechanistically, we focused on the role of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and activation of the inflammasome in these events. ECVs loaded with Aβ (Aβ-ECVs) were readily taken up by NPCs and Aβ partly colocalized with the inflammasome markers ASC and NLRP3 in the nuclei of the recipient NPCs. This colocalization was affected by HIV and RAGE inhibition by a high-affinity specific inhibitor FPS-ZM1. Blocking RAGE resulted also in an increase in ECV number produced by brain endothelial cells, decreased Aβ content in ECVs, and diminished Aβ-ECVs transfer to NPC nuclei. Interestingly, both Aβ-ECVs and RAGE inhibition altered NPC differentiation. Overall, these data indicate that RAGE inhibition affects brain endothelial ECV release and Aβ-ECVs transfer to NPCs.

Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6, TLR4 knockout (TLR4 -KO) mice and hippocampal neurons from the two type mice were respectively divided into two groups: (1) Veh group; (2) B2M-treated group. The behavioral responses of mice were measured using Morris Water Maze. Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal damage, inflammatory response, apoptosis, synaptic proteins and neurotrophic factors, and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway proteins were examined using molecular biological or histopathological methods. The results showed that WT mice received B2M in the DG exhibited age-related cognitive declines, increased TLR4 mRNA expression and high levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and apoptotic neuronal death in the hippocampus, which were partially attenuated in TLR4-KO mice. Moreover, in absence of TLR4, B2M treatment improved hippocampus neurogenesis and increased synaptic related proteins. Our cell experiments further demonstrated that deletion of TLR4 could significantly increase synaptic related protein, decrease neuroinflammatory fators, inhibited apoptotic neuronal death, and regulated MyD88/NF-κB signal pathway after B2M treatment. In summary, our results support the TLR4 contributes to B2M-induced age-related cognitive decline due to neuroinflammation and apoptosis through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway via a modulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic function.

However, the role of ELKS—a protein from the same family as CAST—and the synergistic roles of CAST/ELKS have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly with regard to mouse behavior. Here, we generated ELKS conditional KO in mouse forebrain synapses by crossing ELKS flox mice with a CaMKII promoter-induced Cre line. Results showed that CAST is dominant at these synapses and that ELKS can support CAST function, but is less effective in the ELKS single KO.

Interneurons located in stratum oriens/alveus (O/A INs) receive excitatory inputs from CA1 pyramidal cells and express a Hebbian form of long-term potentiation (LTP) at their excitatory input synapses. This LTP requires the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1a (mGluR1a) and Ca2+ entry via transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. However, the type of TRP channels involved in synaptic transmission at these synapses remains largely unknown. Using patch-clamp recordings, we show that slow excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked in O/A INs are dependent on TRP channels but may be independent of phospholipase C. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we found that mRNA for TRPC 1, 3–7 was present in CA1 hippocampus. Using single-cell RT-PCR, we found expression of mRNA for TRPC 1, 4–7, but not TRPC3, in O/A INs. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK-293 cell expression system, we found that TRPC1 and TRPC4 interacted with mGluR1a. Co-immunoprecipitation in hippocampus showed that TRPC1 interacted with mGluR1a. Using immunofluorescence, we found that TRPC1 co-localized with mGluR1a in O/A IN dendrites, whereas TRPC4 localization appeared limited to O/A IN cell body. Down-regulation of TRPC1, but not TRPC4, expression in O/A INs using small interfering RNAs prevented slow EPSCs, suggesting that TRPC1 is an obligatory TRPC subunit for these EPSCs. Our findings uncover a functional role of TRPC1 in mGluR1a-mediated slow excitatory synaptic transmission onto O/A INs that could be involved in Hebbian LTP at these synapses.","c(""Hippocampus"", ""GABA i ter euro s"", ""TRPC subtypes"", ""siRNA"", ""mGluR1a-mediated slow EPSC"")","Jean-Claude Lacaille","jean-laude.laaille@umontreal.a","29 January 2020"

How these proteins are transported from soma to synapses, and how they become concentrated at SV clusters at presynaptic terminals were examined by immunogold electron microscopy in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons at 3–6 days in culture, a developmental stage when axonal transport of SV proteins is robust. In neuronal somas, labels for the SV integral membrane proteins (synaptophysin, SV2, VAMP/synaptobrevin, and synaptotagmin) were localized at Golgi complexes and other membranous structures that were dispersed in the cytoplasm as individual vesicle/vacuoles. These vesicles/vacuoles became aggregated in axons, with the size of aggregates ranging from 0.2 to 2 μm in length. Pleomorphic vesicle/vacuoles within the aggregate were typically larger (50–300 nm) than SVs, which were uniform in size at ~ 40 nm. These pleomorphic vesicles/vacuoles are probably transport cargos carrying SV integral membrane proteins from the soma, and then are preferentially sorted into axons at early developmental stages. Serial thin sections of young axons indicated that many labeled aggregates were not synaptic, and in fact, some of these axons were without dendritic contacts. In contrast, labels for two SV-associated proteins, synapsin I and α-synuclein, were not localized at the Golgi complexes or associated with membranous structures in the soma, but were dispersed in the cytoplasm. However, these SV-associated proteins became highly concentrated on clusters of SV-like vesicles in axons, and such clusters were already distinctive in axons as early as 3 days in culture. These clusters consisted of ~ 4–30 vesicles in single thin sections, and the vesicles were of a uniform size (~ 40 nm). Serial sectioning analysis showed that these clusters could be part of nascent synapses or exist in axons without any dendritic contact. Importantly, the vesicles were intensely labeled for SV integral membrane proteins as well as SV-associated proteins. Thus, these EM observations reveal that the two groups of proteins, SV integral membrane and SV-associated, proceed through different routes of biosynthesis and axon transport, and are only sorted into the same final compartment, SV clusters, when they are in the axons.","c(""Electro microscopy"", ""Axo tra sport"", ""Sy aptophysi "", ""SV2"", ""Sy apsi "", ""Active zo e cytomatrix"")","Jung-Hwa Tao-Cheng","hengs@ninds.nih.gov","20 January 2020"

Evidently, synapses in sensory systems such as auditory brainstem circuits mature rapidly to achieve high-fidelity neurotransmission for sound localization. This depends on a developmental switch in AMPAR composition from slow-gating GluA1-dominant to fast-gating GluA4-dominant, but the mechanisms underlying this switch remain unknown. We hypothesize that patterned stimuli mimicking spontaneous/sound evoked activity in the early postnatal stage drives this gating switch. We examined activity-dependent changes in evoked and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs and mEPSCs) at the calyx of Held synapse by breaking through the postsynaptic membrane at different time points following 2 min of theta burst stimulation (TBS) to afferents in mouse brainstem slices. We found the decay time course of eEPSCs accelerated, but this change was not apparent until > 30 min after TBS. Histogram analyses of the decay time constants of mEPSCs for naive and tetanized synapses revealed two populations centered around τfast ≈ 0.4 and 0.8 ms, but the relative weight of the τ0.4 population over the τ0.8 population increased significantly only in tetanized synapses. Such changes are blocked by NMDAR or mGluR1/5 antagonists or inhibitors of CaMKII, PKC and protein synthesis, and more importantly precluded in GluA4−/− synapses, suggesting GluA4 is the substrate underlying the acceleration. Our results demonstrate a novel form of plasticity working through NMDAR and mGluR activation to trigger a gating switch of AMPARs with a temporally delayed onset of expression, ultimately enhancing the development of high-fidelity synaptic transmission.","c(""Activity-depe de t plasticity"", ""Sy aptic tra smissio "", ""Developi g plasticity"", ""AMPAR subu it compositio "", ""Calyx of held-MNTB sy apse"")","Lu-Yang Wang","luyang.wang@utoronto.a","15 January 2020"

Here, we aimed to construct high-brightness HSV anterograde tracers by increasing the expression of exogenous genes carried by H129 viruses. Using a Trojan horse-like strategy, a HSV/AAV (adeno-associated virus) chimaera termed H8 was generated to enhance the expression of a fluorescent marker. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that the exogenous gene was efficiently replicated and amplified by the synergism of the HSV vector and introduced AAV replication system. H8 reporting fluorescence was brighter than that of currently available H129 tracers, and H8 could be used for fast and effective anterograde tracing without additional immunostaining.

Since oxidized proteins can be targeted by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we investigated whether increased proteasome activity might affect the stress response in mice. Transgenic mice, expressing the N-terminally deleted version of α3 subunit (α3ΔN) of the proteasome, which has been shown to generate open-gated mutant proteasomes, in the forebrain were viable and fertile, but showed higher proteasome activity. After being challenged with CRS for 14 d, the mutant mice with hyperactive proteasomes showed significantly less immobility time in the forced swimming test compared with their wild-type littermates, suggesting that the α3ΔN transgenic mice are resistant to CRS. The accumulation of ER stress markers, such as polyubiquitin conjugates and phospho-IRE1α, was also significantly delayed in the hippocampus of the mutants. Notably, α3ΔN mice exhibited little deficits in other behavioral tasks, suggesting that stress resilience is likely due to the degradation of misfolded proteins by the open-gated proteasomes.

Amygdala is one of the kernel brain regions mediating stress-coping in the brain. However, little is known about whether early life stress may affect amygdala to have its inoculative effect. Here, we observed that moderate maternal separation (MS) from postnatal day 3 to day 21 (D3–21, 1 h per day) significantly alleviated the increased anxiety-like behavior induced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in adulthood, suggesting an obvious inoculative effect of moderate MS. Further studies revealed that MS prevented CSDS-evoked augmentation of glutamatergic transmission onto principal neurons (PNs) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) by inhibiting presynaptic glutamate release. By contrast, it did not affect GABAergic transmission in BLA PNs, as indicated by unaltered frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Moreover, the CSDS-induced increase of neuronal excitability was also mitigated by MS in BLA PNs.

However, the existence of AHN in humans, particularly in elderly individuals, remains to be determined. Recently, several studies reported that neural progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and immature neurons were detected in the hippocampus of elderly humans, based on the expressions of putative markers for these cells, claiming that this provides evidence of the persistence of AHN in humans. Herein, we briefly overview the phenomenon that we call “dematuration,” in which mature neurons dedifferentiate to a pseudo-immature status and re-express the molecular markers of neural progenitor cells and immature neurons. Various conditions can easily induce dematuration, such as inflammation and hyper-excitation of neurons, and therefore, the markers for neural progenitor cells and immature neurons may not necessarily serve as markers for AHN. Thus, the aforementioned studies have not presented definitive evidence for the persistence of hippocampal neurogenesis throughout adult life in humans, and we would like to emphasize that those markers should be used cautiously when presented as evidence for AHN. Increasing AHN has been considered as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, given that immature neuronal markers can be re-expressed in mature adult neurons, independent of AHN, in various disease conditions including AD, strategies to increase the expression of these markers in the DG may be ineffective or may worsen the symptoms of such diseases.","c(""Hippocampus"", ""De tate gyrus"", ""Gra ule cells"", ""Dematuratio "", ""Adult euroge esis"")","Tsuyoshi Miyakawa","miyakawa@fujita-hu.a.jp","10 December 2019"

We longitudinally monitored locomotor activity in the home cage, and subsequently collected peripheral blood and performed metabolomic analyses. We then constructed cross-validated linear regression models based on blood metabolome patterns to predict locomotor activity levels of individual mice. Our analysis revealed a significant correlation between actual and predicted activity levels, indicative of successful predictions. Pathway analysis of metabolites used for successful predictions showed enrichment in mitochondria metabolism-related terms, such as “Warburg effect” and “citric acid cycle.” In addition, we found that peripheral blood metabolome patterns predicted expression levels of genes implicated in bipolar disorder in the hippocampus, a brain region responsible for mood regulation, suggesting that the brain–periphery axis is related to mood-change-associated behaviors.

More than 20 years of multidisciplinary studies have shown that brain zinc dyshomeostasis may play a critical role in AD progression, which provides encouraging clues for metal-targeted therapies in the treatment of AD. Unfortunately, the pilot clinical application of zinc chelator and/or ionophore strategy, such as the use of quinoline-based compounds, namely clioquinol and PBT2, has not yet been successful. The emerging findings revealed a list of key zinc transporters whose mRNA or protein levels were abnormally altered at different stages of AD brains.

Although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, it shed new light on the treatment or prevention of the disease.

We have recently reported that male mice subjected to spared injury of the sciatic nerve undergo changes in the function of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that culminate in reduced output of layer 5 pyramidal cells. More recently, we have shown that this is mediated by alterations in synaptic inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) into GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC. Optogenetic inhibition of these inputs reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in male mice. It is known that the processing of pain signals can exhibit marked sex differences. We therefore tested whether the dysregulation of BLA to mPFC signaling is equally altered in female mice. Injection of AAV-Arch3.0 constructs into the BLA followed by implantation of a fiberoptic cannula into the mPFC in sham and SNI operated female mice was carried out, and pain behavioral responses were measured in response to yellow light mediated activation of this inhibitory opsin. Our data reveal that Arch3.0 activation leads to a marked increase in paw withdrawal thresholds and latencies in response to mechanical and thermal stimuli, respectively.

Recent reports from our group and others demonstrate a role of FUS in maintaining genome integrity and the DNA damage response (DDR). FUS interacts with many DDR proteins and may regulate their recruitment at damage sites. Given the role of FUS in RNA transactions, here we explore whether FUS also regulates the expression of DDR factors. We performed RT2 PCR arrays for DNA repair and DDR signaling pathways in CRISPR/Cas9 FUS knockout (KO) and shRNA mediated FUS knockdown (KD) cells, which revealed significant (> 2-fold) downregulation of BRCA1, DNA ligase 4, MSH complex and RAD23B. Importantly, similar perturbations in these factors were also consistent in motor neurons differentiated from an ALS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line with a FUS-P525L mutation, as well as in postmortem spinal cord tissue of sporadic ALS patients with FUS pathology. BRCA1 depletion has been linked to neuronal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) accumulation and cognitive defects. The ubiquitin receptor RAD23 functions both in nucleotide excision repair and proteasomal protein clearance pathway and is thus linked to neurodegeneration. Together, our study suggests that the FUS pathology perturbs DDR signaling via both its direct role and the effect on the expression of DDR genes.

Electrophysiological analyses revealed that both channel isoforms exhibit DAMGO-induced voltage-dependent (Gβγ-mediated) inhibition and its recovery by voltage pre-pulses, as well as a voltage-independent component. However, the two channel isoforms differ in their relative extent of voltage-dependent and independent inhibition, with Cav2.2-37b showing significantly more voltage-dependent inhibition upon activation of the three mMOR receptors studied. In addition, coexpression of either mMOR1 or mMOR1C results in an agonist-independent reduction in the peak current density of Cav2.2-37a channels, whereas the peak current density of Cav2.2-37b does not appear to be affected. Interestingly, this decrease is not due to an effect on channel expression at the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by biotinylation experiments. We further examined the mechanism underlying the agonist-independent modulation of Cav2.2-37a by mMOR1C. Incubation of cells with pertussis toxin did not affect the mMOR1C mediated inhibition of Cav2.2-37a currents, indicating a lack of involvement of Gi/o signaling. However, when a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor was applied, the effect of mMOR1C was lost.

Altogether our findings show that Cav2.2-37a and Cav2.2-37b isoforms are subject to differential regulation by C-terminal splice variants of mMORs, and that constitutive mMOR1C activity and downstream tyrosine kinase activity exert a selective inhibition of the Cav2.2-37a splice variant, an N-type channel isoform that is highly enriched in nociceptors.

Recent studies using mouse models of RASopathies demonstrated that particular mutations associated with each disorder disrupt CNS development in a mutation-specific manner. Here, we reviewed the recent literatures that investigated the developmental role of RASopathy-associated mutations using mutant mice, which provided insights into the specific contribution of RAS-ERK signaling molecules to CNS development and the subsequent impact on cognitive function in adult mice.","c(""RAS"", ""MAPK"", "" eurodevelopme tal disorders"", ""cog itio "", ""muta t strai s mouse"")","Yong-Seok Lee","yongseok7@snu.a.kr","21 November 2019"

EFMR is also often associated with autism-like symptoms. In mice and humans, epilepsy occurs only in heterozygous females who have a mixture of PCDH19 wild-type (WT) and mutant cells caused by random X-inactivation; it does not occur in hemizygous PCDH19 mutant males. This unique inheritance pattern strongly suggests the underlying disease mechanism operates via interference between WT and mutant cells rather than being a result of complete loss of PCDH19 functions. Although it remains unclear whether the other symptoms of EFMR also conform to this unique genotype-phenotype relationship, PCDH19 mutant males were recently reported to demonstrate autism-like symptoms. We, therefore, used a Pcdh19 knockout (KO) mouse model to ask whether a complete lack of PCDH19 causes autism-like behaviors. Consistent with the autism observed in EFMR females, we found Pcdh19 heterozygous KO female mice (with mosaic expression of PCDH19) show defects in sociability in the 3-chamber test. Surprisingly, hemizygous Pcdh19 KO male mice (without any PCDH19 expression) exhibit impaired sociability in the 3-chamber test and reduced social interactions in the reciprocal social interaction test. We also observed that, compared to WT mice, mutant mice display more repetitive behaviors, including self-grooming and rearing. These findings indicate that hemizygous Pcdh19 KO male mice show autism-like phenotypes.","list()","Chul Hoon Kim","kimhoon@yuhs.a","20 November 2019"

Here, we use knockout (KO) mice to show the role of GAREM2, that is highly expressed in the brain. According to the comprehensive behavioral battery, they exhibited less anxiety both in elevated plus maze and open field tests, mildly increased social approaching behavior in the reciprocal social interaction test, and longer latency to immobility in the tail suspension test as compared to wild-type (WT). Additionally, the extension of neurites in the primary cultured neurons was suppressed in ones derived from GAREM2 KO mice. Furthermore, we also identified Intersectin, as a binding partner of GAREM2 in this study. Intersectin is also a multi-domain adaptor protein that regulates endocytosis and cell signaling, which can potentially alter the subcellular localization of GAREM2. The important molecules, such as the neurotrophin receptor and Erk family, that are involved in the signaling pathway of the neural cell growth in the mouse brain, have been reported to participate in emotional behavior. As GAREM plays a role in the cellular growth factor receptor signaling pathway, GAREM2 may have a common role related to the transduction of Erk signaling in the higher brain functions.","c(""Adaptor protei "", ""Tyrosi e phosphorylatio "", ""Behavior tests"", ""Neuro "", ""K ockout mouse"", ""Brai fu ctio "")","Hiroaki Konishi","hkonishi@pu-hiroshima.a.jp","12 November 2019"

The GABRA1 (R214C) variant was identified using whole exome sequencing, and the pathogenic effect of this mutation was investigated by comparing wild-type (WT) α1 and R214C α1 GABAA receptor-expressing HEK cells. GABA-evoked currents in these cells were recorded using whole-cell, outside-out macro-patch and cell-attached single-channel patch-clamp recordings. Changes to surface and total protein expression levels of WT α1 and R214C α1 were quantified using surface biotinylation assay and western blotting, respectively. Finally, potential therapeutic options were explored by determining the effects of modulators, including diazepam, insulin, and verapamil, on channel gating and receptor trafficking of WT and R214C GABAA receptors. We found that the GABRA1 (R214C) variant decreased whole-cell GABA-evoked currents by reducing single channel open time and both surface and total GABAA receptor expression levels. The GABA-evoked currents in R214C GABAA receptors could only be partially restored with benzodiazepine (diazepam) and insulin. However, verapamil treatment for 24 h fully restored the function of R214C mutant receptors, primarily by increasing channel open time. We conclude that the GABRA1 (R214C) variant reduces channel activity and surface expression of mutant receptors, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of genetic EE. The functional restoration by verapamil suggests that it is a potentially new therapeutic option for patients with the R214C variant and highlights the value of precision medicine in the treatment of genetic EEs.","c(""GABA a receptor"", ""Epileptic e cephalopathy"", ""Mutatio "", ""Therapeutic optio s"")","c(""Lidong Liu"", ""Michelle Demos"", ""Yu Tian Wang"")","""lidong@mail.ub.a"", ""mdemos@w.b.a"", ""ytwang@brain.ub.a""","10 November 2019"

Diabetes is a chronic disease, and metabolic factors affecting brain metabolisms, such as serum glucose, insulin, and glucagon, are altered according to disease progression. In our previous study, we applied hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy in prediabetic mice after feeding them a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 months. Ultimately, we detected significantly increased [1-13C]lactate conversion in the whole brain and an almost five-fold increased [1-13C]lactate/pyruvate ratio in the hippocampal region. In the present study, we induced diabetes in mice by injecting streptozotocin and feeding them an HFD for 6 months. Unlike in prediabetic mice, [1-13C]lactate conversion in the diabetic mice did not differ from that in the control group, but [1-13C]lactate/total 13C ratio showed an almost 1.4-fold increase in the hippocampal region. We measured the amount of the lactate and mRNA levels of glucose transporters from isolated hippocampus and cortex samples. In the hippocampus, significantly decreased GLUT1 mRNA levels and increased lactate were detected, suggesting an inconsistency between glucose and pyruvate metabolism. Pyruvate can be produced from oxaloacetate as well as glucose. We investigated ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) because it cleaves citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA. Phosphorylated ACLY (Ser455), the active form, was increased in both hippocampus and cortex samples of mice injected with streptozotocin and fed an HFD. Also, phosphorylated ACLY/total ACLY showed a positive correlation with lactate amount in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that the brain has different responses to diabetic progression, but, in the hippocampus, maintains metabolic alteration toward increasing lactate production from the prediabetic to the diabetic stage.

PD also has various non-classical symptoms, including cognitive impairments. In addition, inflammation and astrogliosis are recognized as an integral part of PD pathology. The hippocampus (Hipp) is a brain region involved in cognition and memory, and the neuropeptide orexin has been shown to enhance learning and memory. Previous studies show impairments in Hipp-dependent memory in a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson’s disease (A53T mice), and we hypothesized that increasing orexin tone will reverse this. To test this, we subjected 3, 5, and 7-month old A53T mice to a Barnes maze and a contextual object recognition test to determine Hipp dependent memory. Inflammation and astrogliosis markers in the Hipp were assessed by immuno-fluorescence densitometry. The data show that early cognitive impairment is coupled with an increase in expression of inflammatory and astrogliosis markers. Next, in two separate experiments, mice were given intra-hippocampal injections of orexin or chemogenetic viral injections of an orexin neuron specific Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD). For the pharmacological approach mice were intracranially treated with orexin A, whereas the chemogenetic approach utilized clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Both pharmacological orexin A intervention as well as chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons ameliorated Hipp-dependent early memory impairment observed in A53T mice.

Adult C57BL/6 J mice were placed in running wheels and allowed for voluntary running 2 weeks. Myelin levels in the central nervous system were detected using western blotting, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemical staining, and electron microscopy. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes (OLs) were detected using immunohistochemical staining and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assays. Motor abilities of the animals were examined using open-field, rotarod running, and beam-walking behavioral paradigms. Vital molecules of Wnt signaling were detected, and the involvement of such molecules was verified using in vitro culture of OPCs. Our results showed that VWR significantly enhanced the myelination in the motor cortex. VWR promoted the proliferation and differentiation of OPCs, and the maturation of OLs. The VWR-regulated myelination was associated with the improved motor skill and decreased mRNA level of Wnt3a/9a, whereas stimulation of Wnt signaling pathway with Wnt3a or Wnt9a suppressed OPCs proliferation and differentiation in vitro.

Four cell-specific sites of alternative splicing in Cacna1b that alter CaV2.2 channel function have been described in detail: three cassette exons (e18a, e24a, and e31a) and a pair of mutually exclusive exons (e37a/e37b).

MiR-212-5p has previously been reported to be downregulated in extracellular vesicles following TBI. To investigate whether miR-212-5p is involved in the ferroptotic neuronal death in TBI mice, we first examined the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and ferrous ion, and the expression of ferroptosis-related molecules at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h following controlled cortical impact (CCI) in mice. There was a significant upregulation in the expression of Gpx4 and Acsl4 at 6 h, Slc7a11 from 12 h to 72 h, and Nox2 and Sat1 from 6 h to 72 h post injury. Similarly, an upregulation in the expression of Gpx4 at 6 h, Nox2 from 6 h to 72 h, xCT from 12 h to 72 h, and Sat1 at 72 h after CCI was observed at the protein level. Interestingly, MDA and ferrous ion were increased whereas miR-212-5p was decreased in the CCI group compared to the sham group. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of miR-212-5p attenuated ferroptosis while downregulation of miR-212-5p promoted ferroptotic cell death partially by targeting prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (Ptgs2) in HT-22 and Neuro-2a cell lines. In addition, administration of miR-212-5p in CCI mice significantly improved learning and spatial memory.

Next, we tested for the effect of F1 on the expression level of key molecules involved in learning and memory. Results from Western blot assay revealed that an abnormally reduced level of a phosphorylated form of CREB in the hippocampus of AD mice was restored to a normal level by F1 administration.

This study was designed to examine the role of anterior insular cortex (aIC) in the pathogenesis of hyperalgesia in a rat model of CP. CP was induced by intraductal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Abdomen hyperalgesia and anxiety were assessed by von Frey filament and open field tests, respectively. Two weeks after surgery, the activation of aIC was indicated by FOS immunohistochemical staining and electrophysiological recordings. Expressions of VGluT1, NMDAR subunit NR2B and AMPAR subunit GluR1 were analyzed by immunoblottings. The regulatory roles of aIC in hyperalgesia and pain-related anxiety were detected via pharmacological approach and chemogenetics in CP rats. Our results showed that TNBS treatment resulted in long-term hyperalgesia and anxiety-like behavior in rats. CP rats exhibited increased FOS expression and potentiated excitatory synaptic transmission within aIC. CP rats also showed up-regulated expression of VGluT1, and increased membrane trafficking and phosphorylation of NR2B and GluR1 within aIC. Blocking excitatory synaptic transmission significantly attenuated abdomen mechanical hyperalgesia. Specifically inhibiting the excitability of insular pyramidal cells reduced both abdomen hyperalgesia and pain-related anxiety.

Here we report that wildtype AnkB increased overall Cav2.1 levels without impacting surface Cav2.1 levels in HEK293T cells. An AnkB variant, p.S646F, which we recently discovered to be associated with seizures, further increased overall Cav2.1 levels, again with no impact on surface Cav2.1 levels.

In addition, we found that partial deletion of AnkB in cortex resulted in a decrease in overall Cav2.1 levels, with no change to the levels of Cav2.1 detected in synaptosome fractions. Our work suggests that depending on the particular variant, AnkB regulates intracellular and surface Cav2.1. Notably, expression of the AnkB variant associated with seizure (AnkB p.S646F) caused further increase in intracellular Cav2.1 levels above that of even wildtype AnkB.

WBS is a neurodevelopmental disorder and characterized by cognitive disorder. We generated single-gene Nsun5 knockout (Nsun5-KO) mice and reported that the Nsun5 deletion leads to deficit in spatial cognition. This study focused on investigating the influence of Nsun5 deficiency in the development of cerebral cortex. In comparison with wild-type littermates, the cortical thickness in postnatal day 10 Nsun5-KO mice was obviously reduced with an abnormal laminar organization, and the processes of pyramidal cells were shorter and finer. Nsun5 was selectively expressed in radial glial cells (RGCs) of cerebral cortex from embryonic day (E) 12.5 to E16.5, but not in intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) or neocortical neurons. The Nsun5 deletion did not alter proliferation of RGCs or differentiation of RGCs into IPCs. Notably, the ablation of Nsun5 disrupted the growth of radial glial scaffolds, thus numerous basal processes of RGCs failed to reach pial basement membrane. Level of cell polarity regulator Cdc42 protein in radial glial scaffolds of E14.5 Nsun5-KO mice was reduced, but the level of Cdc42 mRNA was unchanged. The dysfunction of glial scaffolds impeded the radial migration of upper-layer and deeper-layer neurons to cause their subcortical accumulation and apoptosis, resulting in an obvious thinness of the cortical plate in E18.5 Nsun5-KO mice. These findings establish a critical role of Nsun5 in development of cerebral cortex through regulating radial glial scaffolds of RGCs to control migration of neocortical neurons.","c(""Cerebral cortex"", ""Migrati g euro s"", ""Nsu 5"", ""Radial glial cells (RGCs)"", ""Williams-Beure sy drome (WBS)"")","c(""Bin Shen"", ""Ling Chen"")","""binshen@njmu.edu.n"", ""linghen@njmu.edu.n""","28 August 2019"

We show that endogenous USP5 protein expressed in dorsal root ganglia undergoes SUMOylation, and the level of USP5 SUMOylation is reduced following peripheral nerve injury. SUMO prediction software identified several putative lysines that have the propensity to be targets for SUMO conjugation. A series of single lysine substitutions in an mCherry tagged USP5 construct followed by expression in tsA-201 cells identified lysine K113 as a key target for USP5 SUMO2/3 modification.

These changes, with stress before pregnancy, are potential risk factors for the development of postpartum depression (PPD). A valid animal model of PPD is needed to understand the neurobiological basis of the depressive state of females. To explore a mouse model of PPD, we first assessed anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors in nulliparous (virgin), nonlactating primiparous, and lactating primiparous females in four inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6J, C57BL/6JJcl, BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj, and BALB/cAJcl). Pups from the nonlactating female group were removed one day after parturition to examine the effects of physical interaction with pups on the postpartum behaviors. Second, we investigated the additional effects of prepregnancy stress (restraint stress for 6 h/day for 21 days) on postpartum behaviors in the BALB/cAJcl strain. We found that females of the two BALB/c substrains showed decreased locomotor activity and increased anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors compared with females of the two C57BL/6 substrains. Behavioral differences were also observed between the two substrains of each strain. Additionally, pregnancy- and lactation-dependent behavioral differences were found in some strains: lactating BALB/cAJcl females traveled shorter distance than the females of the other reproductive state groups, while nonlactating and lactating BALB/cAJcl and C57BL/6J females showed increased depression-related behavior compared with nulliparous females. Lactating BALB/cAJcl and C57BL/6JJcl females exhibited decreased sucrose preference or anhedonia-like behavior compared with nulliparous and nonlactating females, although these results did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple testing. An additional independent experiment replicated the marked behavioral changes in lactating BALB/cAJcl females. Moreover, increased anxiety-like behavior was observed in lactating BALB/cAJcl females that experienced prepregnancy stress. These results suggest genetic contributions to the regulation of anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors in female mice. Furthermore, this study suggests that pregnancy and lactation cause decreased locomotor activity and increased depression-related behaviors, which was consistently found in our results, and that prepregnancy stress enhances anxiety-like behavior in the BALB/cAJcl strain.

To evaluate the effects of FLX in the primate brain, we used immunohistological methods to assess neurogenesis and the expression of neuronal maturity markers following chronic FLX treatment (3 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) in adult marmosets (n = 3 per group). We found increased expression of doublecortin and calretinin, markers of immature neurons, in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of FLX-treated marmosets. Further, FLX treatment reduced parvalbumin expression and the number of neurons with perineuronal nets, which indicate mature fast-spiking interneurons, in the hippocampus, but not in the amygdala or cerebral cortex. We also found that FLX treatment increased the generation of cortical interneurons; however, significant up-regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis was not observed in FLX-treated marmosets. These results suggest that dematuration of hippocampal neurons and increased cortical neurogenesis may play roles in FLX-induced effects and/or side effects. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies showing hippocampal dematuration and increased cortical neurogenesis in FLX-treated rodents.

On the other hand, repeated exposure to social defeat (SD) stress by aggressor mice induces social avoidance behavior to the aggressor and chronic anxiety-like behavior. In this study, we assumed this SD stress paradigm as a PTSD-like model and examined the effects of treatment with neurogenesis enhancer MEM on SD stress-induced PTSD-like behavior. Male C57BL/6 mice received SD stress for 10 consecutive days and were assessed for social avoidance memory to the aggressor (memory of aggressor mice) and anxiety-like behavior using social interaction and elevated zero maze tasks. Consistent with previous studies, SD mice formed social avoidance memory and exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior. Importantly, subsequent MEM treatment (once a week for 4 weeks) significantly reduced social avoidance behavior, suggesting that MEM-treated SD mice showed forgetting of social avoidance memory. Interestingly, MEM-treated SD mice showed comparable anxiety-like behavior with control mice that were not exposed to SD stress. Moreover, MEM-treated SD mice showed no reinstatement of social avoidance memory following single re-exposure to the aggressor.

We show that FMRP is required for translation downstream of NMDAR stimulation and MOV10 is the key specificity factor in this process. In rat cortical synaptoneurosomes, MOV10 in association with FMRP and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) forms the inhibitory complex on a subset of NMDAR responsive mRNAs. On NMDAR stimulation, MOV10 dissociates from AGO2 and promotes the translation of its target mRNAs. FMRP is required to form MOV10-AGO2 inhibitory complex and to promote translation of MOV10 associated mRNAs. Phosphorylation of FMRP appears to be the potential switch for NMDAR mediated translation and in the absence of FMRP, the distinct translation response to NMDAR stimulation is lost.

There was consistent RAB11 downregulation in all ALS cases, while p-AKT and phospho-ribosomal S6 kinase (p-p90RSK) were upregulated. Furthermore, competition between AKT and ERK pathways was observed in ALS, suggesting subtle differences among the TDP-43-ALS subtypes, which may influence patient therapeutic responses.

Thus, we attempted to investigate the gene expression and protein distribution of CAPN5 in the olfactory epithelium compared with that in the central nervous system (CNS). By performing reverse-transcriptase PCR and in situ hybridization, we confirmed that CAPN5 mRNA was expressed in the olfactory epithelium. We then performed immunohistological investigations using sliced preparations obtained from mice expressing GFP under OMP promoter activity. The detected GFP fluorescence was restricted to the knob, soma and axon bundles of the ORNs, while CAPN5 immunoreactivity (CAPN5-IR) was ubiquitously detected in the olfactory epithelial layer and lamina propria; signals were strongly detected in the supporting cells within the epithelium. In the CNS, CAPN5 signals were widely detected and were especially strong in the hippocampal formation and the piriform cortex as previously indicated.

We found that the phosphorylation sites were highly proline directed and primarily mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) dependent, due to particular activation of c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), a member of the MAPK family. Because the MAPK/JNK pathway is also involved in axon regeneration of invertebrate model organisms such Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, we performed evolutionary bioinformatics analysis of the mammalian growth cone phosphorylation sites. Although these sites were generally conserved within vertebrates, they were not necessarily conserved in these invertebrate model organisms. In particular, high-frequency phosphorylation sites (> 20 times) were less conserved than low-frequency sites. Taken together, the mammalian growth cones contain a large number of vertebrate-specific phosphorylation sites and stronger dependence upon MAPK/JNK than C. elegans or Drosophila.

Netrins are axonal guidance molecules that are conserved regulators of embryonic nerve cord patterning. However, whether they contribute to MB morphogenesis has not yet been evaluated. Here, we find that Netrin-B (NetB) is highly expressed in the MB lobes, regulating lobe length through genetic interactions with the receptors Frazzled and Uncoordinated-5 from 24 h after pupal formation onwards. We observe that overexpression of NetB causes severe β lobe fusion in the MB, which is similar to the MB defects seen in the Drosophila model of fragile X syndrome (FXS). Our results further show that fragile-X mental retardation protein FMRP inhibits the translational activity of human ortholog Netrin-1 (NTN1).

We observed increased Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity in BBS mouse brains. Increased GFAP expression is a hallmark of astrocyte reactivity that is associated with microglia activation and neuro-inflammation. To gain a better understanding of reactive astrocytes observed in BBS mice, we used two mouse models of BBS8, a BBSome protein, to characterize the reactive astrocyte phenotype. The finding of reactive astrocytes in young BBS mouse brains led us to hypothesize that loss of BBSome function leads to reactive astrocytes prior to hydrocephalus and obesity. By using two mouse models of BBS8, a congenital BBS8 knockout with hydrocephalus, and a tamoxifen-inducible BBS8 knockout without hydrocephalus, we were able to molecularly phenotype the reactive astrocytes. Molecular phenotype of reactive astrocytes shows differential regulation of inducers of Pan, A1 neurotoxic, and A2 neuroprotective astrocytes that are significantly altered in brains of both congenital and induced knockouts of BBS8, but without microglia activation. We find evidence for neuroinflammation in the brains of congenital knockout mice, but not in induced knockout mice. Protein levels of GFAP, SERPINA3N and post-synaptic density 95 (PSD95) are significantly increased in congenital knockout mice, but remain unchanged in induced knockout mice. Thus, despite the reactive astrocyte phenotype being present in both models, the molecular signature of reactive astrocytes in BBS8 mice models are distinct. Together, these findings suggest that BBS8, and by extension the BBSome, plays a role in neuro-astrocyte functions independent of hydrocephalus, and its dysregulation is associated with astrocyte reactivity without microglia activation.

AD develops over decades but detailed molecular analysis of AD brains is limited to postmortem tissue where the stresses initiating the disease may be obscured by compensatory responses and neurodegenerative processes. Rare, dominant mutations in a small number of genes, but particularly the gene PRESENILIN 1 (PSEN1), drive early onset of familial AD (EOfAD). Numerous transgenic models of AD have been constructed in mouse and other organisms, but transcriptomic analysis of these models has raised serious doubts regarding their representation of the disease state. Since we lack clarity regarding the molecular mechanism(s) underlying AD, we posit that the most valid approach is to model the human EOfAD genetic state as closely as possible. Therefore, we sought to analyse brains from zebrafish heterozygous for a single, EOfAD-like mutation in their PSEN1-orthologous gene, psen1. We previously introduced an EOfAD-like mutation (Q96_K97del) into the endogenous psen1 gene of zebrafish. Here, we analysed transcriptomes of young adult (6-month-old) entire brains from a family of heterozygous mutant and wild type sibling fish.

Different from unpredictable chronic stress, which is a well-established animal model for depression, predictable chronic mild stress (PCMS), a routine stress experienced in day-to-day life, has been demonstrated to improve mood and memory. In the present study, we assess the effects of PCMS (5 min of daily restrain stress for 4 weeks) on depressive-like behavior, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and pyrin domain containing three (NLRP3) activation in hippocampus of mice subjected to peripheral immune challenge by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that PCMS facilitated the recovery from LPS-induced depressive- or anxiety-like behavior. Concurrent with the reversal of abnormal behavioral changes, PCMS suppressed LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression, microglia activation, and oxidative stress in hippocampus. Correspondingly, PCMS inhibited LPS-induced overactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) maturation. Nrf2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) signaling was demonstrated to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome overactivation and oxidative stress. PCMS activated Nrf2 signaling and inhibited thioredoxin (Trx)-interacting protein (TXNIP) expression in LPS-treated mice. Collectively, present data suggest that PCMS, contrary to severe and uncontrolled stress, alleviated impairments of the Nrf2-TXNIP-Trx system and may contribute to inflammatory brain damage and the imbalance of cellular redox homeostasis in depressed mice. This study provides a mechanistic link to the resilience of PCMS to LPS-induced behavioral deficits.","c(""Predictable chro ic mild stress"", ""Neuroi flammatio "", ""Depressio "", ""NLRP3"")","Ming-gao Zhao","minggao@fmmu.edu.n","03 May 2019"

Recent studies suggest that each SV protein is sorted into individual SVs by its own dedicated adaptors as well as by association between SV proteins. The SH3-containing GRB2-like protein 3-interacting protein 1 (SGIP1), an ortholog of Fer/Cip4 homology domain-only (FCHo) proteins, contains a μ-homology domain (μHD) and binds AP-2 and Eps15, thus functioning as an endocytic regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Its longest isoform SGIP1α is predominantly expressed in the brain but the functional significance of SGIP1 in SV recycling remains unknown. Here, we found that SGIP1α, a brain-specific long isoform of SGIP1 binds synaptotagmin1 (Syt1) via its μHD and promotes the internalization of Syt1 on the neuronal surface. The small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown (KD) of SGIP1α caused selective impairment of Syt1 internalization at hippocampal synapses and it was fully rescued by coexpression of the shRNA-resistant form of SGIP1α in KD neurons. We further found that the μHD of SGIP1α is structurally similar to those of AP-2 and stonin2, and mutations at Trp771 and Lys781, which correspond to Syt1-recognition motifs of AP-2 and stonin2, to Ala bound less efficiently to Syt1 and failed to rescue the endocytic defect of Syt1 caused by KD. Our results indicate that SGIP1α is an endocytic adaptor dedicated to the retrieval of surface-stranded Syt1. Since endocytic sorting of Syt1 is also mediated by the overlapping activities of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A/B (SV2A/B) and stonin2, our results suggest that complementary fail-safe mechanism by these proteins ensures high fidelity of Syt1 retrieval.","c(""SGIP1α"", ""sy aptotagmi  1"", ""Sy aptic vesicle"", ""Clathri -mediated e docytosis"")","Sunghoe Chang","sunghoe@snu.a.kr","03 May 2019"

To determine whether these cadherins may be linked to the morphogenesis of ASD-relevant brain regions, in situ hybridization (ISH) experiments were carried out to examine the mRNA expression profiles of two ASD-associated cadherins, Cdh9 and Cdh11, in the developing cerebellum. During the first postnatal week, both Cdh9 and Cdh11 were expressed at high levels in segregated sub-populations of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and the expression of both genes was declined as development proceeded. Developmental expression of Cdh11 was largely confined to dorsal lobules (lobules VI/VII) of the vermis as well as the lateral hemisphere area equivalent to the Crus I and Crus II areas in human brains, areas known to mediate high order cognitive functions in adults. Moreover, in lobules VI/VII of the vermis, Cdh9 and Cdh11 were expressed in a complementary pattern with the Cdh11-expressing areas flanked by Cdh9-expressing areas. Interestingly, the high level of Cdh11 expression in the central domain of lobules VI/VII was correlated with a low level of expression of the Purkinje cell marker calbindin, coinciding with a delayed maturation of Purkinje cells in the same area. These findings suggest that these two ASD-associated cadherins may exert distinct but coordinated functions to regulate the wiring of ASD-relevant circuits in the cerebellum.","c(""ASD"", ""Cdh11"", ""Cdh9"", ""Cerebellum"", ""Developme t"", ""I situ hybridizatio "")","Xiao-Bing Yuan","xbyuan@brain.enu.edu.n","02 May 2019"

We have previously shown that the inhibition of mGluR5 using CTEP, a selective negative allosteric mGluR5 modulator, can delay disease progression and reduce in mHTT aggregates in the zQ175 mouse model of HD.

To elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms, we constructed a mouse model by electric foot shock followed by situational reminders and performed transcriptome analysis in brain tissues. The stressed mice acquired anxiety-like behavior after 2 weeks and exaggerated startle response after 4 weeks. Avoidance latency and freezing behavior were sustained up to 5 weeks post stress and abnormal static behavior was observed during the sleep period. RNA sequencing was performed in two of the emotional regulatory regions, anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala, at 2 and 5 weeks post stress. More than 1000 differentially expressed genes were identified at 2 weeks in both regions. The number of the regulated genes remained constant in amygdala at 5 weeks post stress, whereas those in anterior cingulate cortex were plummeted.

In particular, estrogens modulate and mediate spine and synapse formation as well as neurogenesis in the hippocampal formation. In this review, we discuss current research exploring the effects of estrogens on dendritic spine plasticity and neurogenesis with a focus on the modulating factors of sex, age, and pregnancy. Hormone levels, including those of estrogens, fluctuate widely across the lifespan from early life to puberty, through adulthood and into old age, as well as with pregnancy and parturition. Dendritic spine formation and modulation are altered both by rapid (likely non-genomic) and classical (genomic) actions of estrogens and have been suggested to play a role in the effects of estrogens on learning and memory. Neurogenesis in the hippocampus is influenced by age, the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and parity in female rodents. Furthermore, sex differences exist in hippocampal cellular and molecular responses to estrogens and are briefly discussed throughout. Understanding how structural plasticity in the hippocampus is affected by estrogens and how these effects can influence function and be influenced by other factors, such as experience and sex, is critical and can inform future treatments in conditions involving the hippocampus.","c(""Neuroge esis"", ""de dritic spi es"", ""sex differe ces"", ""memory"", ""depressio "", ""stress"", ""agi g"", ""preg a cy"", ""parity"")","Liisa A.

When mice observed and directly experienced fear conditioning in different contexts, preferential reactivation was not observed in the CA1, and fear memory was not enhanced.

Here we focus on the prominent expression of LAMP5 in the brainstem and spinal cord and suggest a role for LAMP5 in these brain regions. LAMP5 was highly expressed in several brainstem nuclei involved with auditory processing including the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary complex, nuclei of the lateral lemniscus and grey matter in the spinal cord. It was localized exclusively in inhibitory synaptic terminals, as has been reported in the forebrain. In the absence of LAMP5, localization of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) was unaltered in the lateral superior olive and the ventral cochlear nuclei, arguing against a conserved role for LAMP5 in trafficking VIAAT. Lamp5 knockout mice showed no overt behavioral abnormality but an increased startle response to auditory and tactile stimuli.

While the species of accumulating proteins are distinct in each disease, an increasing body of evidence indicates that defects in the protein clearance system play a crucial role in the gradual accumulation of protein aggregates. Among protein degradation systems, the endosome-autophagosome-lysosome pathway (EALP) is the main degradation machinery, especially for large protein aggregates. Lysosomal dysfunction or defects in fusion with vesicles containing cargo are commonly observed abnormalities in proteinopathic neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the available evidence for a mechanistic connection between components of the EALP-especially lysosomes-and neurodegenerative diseases.

The ability of spinophilin to alter synaptic strength appears to involve its scaffolding of key synaptic proteins, including the important structural element F-actin, AMPA/NMDA modulator protein phosphatase 1, and neuromodulatory G-protein coupled receptors, including dopamine receptor D2 and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5. Additionally, spinophilin is highly expressed in the striatum, a brain region that is fundamentally involved in reward-processing and locomotor activity which receives both glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of spinophilin in behavioral responses to cocaine, evaluating wild-type and spinophilin knockout mice followed by the examination of underlying molecular alterations. Although acute locomotor response was not affected, deletion of spinophilin blocked the development and expression of behavioral sensitization to cocaine while maintaining normal conditioned place preference. This behavioral alteration in spinophilin knockout mice was accompanied by attenuated c-Fos and ∆FosB expression following cocaine administration and blunted cocaine-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the striatum, with no change in other relevant signaling molecules. Therefore, we suggest spinophilin fulfills an essential role in cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization, likely via ERK1/2 phosphorylation and induction of c-Fos and ∆FosB in the striatum, a mechanism that may underlie specific processes in cocaine addiction.","c(""Drug addictio "", ""Spi ophili "", ""Cocai e"", ""Behavioral se sitizatio "")","Stephen S.

The major targets of the cerebellar projections are the thalamic regions including the ventroanterior nucleus (VA) and ventrolateral nucleus (VL). Another thalamic target is the central lateral nucleus (CL), which receives the innervations mainly from the dentate nucleus (DN) in the cerebellum. Although previous electrophysiological studies suggest the role of the CL as the relay of cerebellar functions, the kinds of behavioral functions mediated by cerebellothalamic tracts projecting to the CL remain unknown. Here, we used immunotoxin (IT) targeting technology combined with a neuron-specific retrograde labeling technique, and selectively eliminated the cerebellothalamic tracts of mice. We confirmed that the number of neurons in the DN was selectively decreased by the IT treatment. These IT-treated mice showed normal overground locomotion with no ataxic behavior. However, elimination of these neurons impaired motor coordination in the rotarod test and forelimb movement in the reaching test. These mice showed intact acquisition and flexible change of spatial information processing in the place discrimination, Morris water maze, and T-maze tests. Although the tract labeling indicated the existence of axonal collaterals of the DN-CL pathway to the rostral part of the VA/VL complex, excitatory lesion of the rostral VA/VL did not show any significant alterations in motor coordination or forelimb reaching, suggesting no requirement of axonal branches connecting to the VL/VA complex for motor skill function.

We investigated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of baicalin in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of ADHD depending on the dopamine (DA) deficit theory. In this study, fifty SHRs were randomly divided into five groups: methylphenidate (MPH), baicalin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, or 150 mg/kg), and saline-treated. Ten Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. All rats were orally administered the treatment for four weeks. Motor activity, spatial learning and memory ability were assessed with the open-field and Morris water-maze tests. The mRNA and protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), synaptosomal-associated protein of molecular mass 25kD (SNAP25) and synataxin 1a in synaptosomes were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot. In addition, DA levels were measured in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The results indicated that both MPH and baicalin at doses of 150 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg significantly decreased the hyperactivity and improved the spatial learning memory deficit in the SHRs and increased the synaptosomal mRNA and protein levels of TH, SNAP25, VMAT2 and synataxin 1a compared with saline treatment. MPH significantly increased DA levels in both the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum, while baicalin significantly increased DA levels only in the striatum. The results of the present study showed that baicalin treatment was effective for controlling the core symptoms of ADHD. Baicalin increased DA levels only in the striatum, which suggested that baicalin may target the striatum. The increased DA levels may partially be attributed to the increased mRNA and protein expression of TH, SNAP25, VMAT2, and syntaxin 1a. Therefore, these results suggested that the pharmacological effects of baicalin were associated with the synthesis, vesicular localization, and release of DA and might be effective in treating ADHD.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether chronic morphine induced similar changes in the morphology of VTA DA neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We utilized Cre-dependent retrograde viral vectors in DA Cre driver lines to label VTA DA neurons that projected to NAc and PFC and assessed neuronal soma size. Consistent with previous data, the soma size of VTA DA neurons that projected to the NAc medial shell was decreased following morphine exposure. However, soma size of VTA DA neurons that projected to the NAc core was unaltered by morphine. Interestingly, morphology of PFC-projecting VTA DA neurons was also altered by morphine, but in this case soma size was increased compared to sham controls. Differences in basal soma size were also noted, suggesting stable differences in projection-specific morphology in addition to drug-induced changes. Together, these data suggest morphine-induced changes in VTA DA morphology occur within distinct VTA DA populations and that study of opiate-induced structural plasticity of individual VTA DA subcircuits may be critical for understanding addiction-related behavior.","c(""Dopami e"", ""Morphi e"", ""Morphology"", ""Opiate"", ""Ve tral tegme tal area"")","Michelle S.

There is interest, therefore, in using epigenomic annotation data to identify the specific regulatory mechanisms involved and prioritize risk variants. We quantified lysine H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) - a robust mark of active enhancers and promoters that is strongly correlated with gene expression and transcription factor binding – across the genome in entorhinal cortex samples using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by highly parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). H3K27ac peaks were called using high quality reads combined across all samples and formed the basis of partitioned heritability analysis using LD score regression along with publicly-available GWAS results for seven psychiatric and neurodegenerative traits.

These neurological symptoms result from synaptic dysregulations, which shift a balance between excitation and inhibition. To decipher the synaptic substrate of hyperexcitability, we examined pan-neuronal Tsc1 knockout mouse and found a reduction in surface expression of a GABA receptor (GABAR) subunit but not AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit. Using electrophysiological recordings, we found a significant reduction in the frequency of GABAR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (GABAR-mIPSCs) but not AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (AMPAR-mEPSCs) in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. To determine a subpopulation of interneurons that are especially vulnerable to the absence of TSC1 function, we also analyzed two strains of conditional knockout mice targeting two of the prominent interneuron subtypes that express parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST). Unlike pan-neuronal knockout mice, both interneuron-specific Tsc-1 knockout mice did not develop spontaneous seizures and grew into adults. Further, the properties of AMPAR-mEPSCs and GABAR-mIPSCs were normal in both Pv-Cre and Sst-Cre x Tsc1fl/fl knockout mice. These results indicate that removal of TSC1 from all neurons in a local cortical circuit results in hyperexcitability while connections between pyramidal neurons and interneurons expressing PV and SST are preserved in the layer 2/3 visual cortex. Our study suggests that another inhibitory cell type or a combination of multiple subtypes may be accountable for hyperexcitability in TSC.","c(""Tuberous sclerosis complex"", ""E/I bala ce"", ""AMPA receptor"", ""GABA receptor"", ""Autism"", ""Epilepsy"", ""mTOR pathway"")","Akira Yoshii","ayoshii@ui.edu","25 January 2019"

Using laser microdissection, to investigate gene expressions in motor neurons caudal to the lesion, we observed a decrease in the expressions of neuronal activity markers.

Rodent pups that are exposed to VPA in utero have been used as an animal model of ASD. Activation of the mTOR signaling pathway was recently observed in rodents that were exposed to VPA in utero, and rapamycin ameliorated social interaction deficits. The present study investigated the effect of rapamycin on social interaction deficits in both adolescence and adulthood, and gene expressions in mice that were exposed to VPA in utero. We subcutaneously injected 600 mg/kg VPA in pregnant mice on gestational day 12.5 and used the pups as a model of ASD. The pups were intraperitoneally injected with rapamycin or an equal volume of vehicle once daily for 2 consecutive days. The social interaction test was conducted in the offspring after the last rapamycin administration at 5–6 weeks of ages (adolescence) or 10–11 weeks of age (adulthood).

Mice that were exposed to VPA and treated with vehicle exhibited a decrease in social interaction compared with control mice that were treated with vehicle. Rapamycin treatment in VPA-exposed mice improved social deficits. Mice that were exposed to VPA and treated with vehicle exhibited the aberrant expression of genes in the mTOR signaling pathway, and rapamycin treatment recovered changes in the expression of some genes, including Fyb and A330094K24Rik. Rapamycin treatment suppressed S6 phosphorylation in VPA-exposed mice. Aberrant gene expression was associated with social interaction deficits in VPA-exposed mice.

However, gain-of-function study manipulating CA3 cell ensembles has not been reported. The CA3 area of the hippocampus comprises a recurrent excitatory circuit, which is thought to be important for the generation of associations among the stored information within one brain region. We investigated whether the coincident firing of cell ensembles in one brain region, hippocampal CA3, associates distinct events. CA3 cell ensembles responding to context exploration and during contextual fear conditioning were labeled with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mCherry. The synchronous activation of these ensembles induced freezing behavior in mice in a neutral context, in which a foot shock had never been delivered. The recall of this artificial associative fear memory was context specific. In vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that 20-Hz optical stimulation of ChR2-mCherry-expressing CA3 neurons, which is the same stimulation protocol used in behavioral experiment, induced long-term potentiation at CA3-CA3 synapses. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the synchronous activation of ensembles in one brain region, CA3 of the hippocampus, is sufficient for the association of distinct events. The results of our electrophysiology potentially suggest that this artificial association of memory events might be induced by the strengthening of synaptic efficacy between CA3 ensembles via recurrent circuit.","c(""Hippocampus"", ""CA3"", ""Recurre t circuit"", ""Artificial associatio "", ""Sy aptic plasticity"", ""Lo g-term pote tiatio (LTP)"", ""Optoge etics"")","Kaoru Inokuchi","inokuhi@med.u-toyama.a.jp","08 January 2019"

Aggression is an innate behaviour, and is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. However, the genetics of aggression remains largely unclear. In this study, we identify the peacefulness (pfs) gene as a novel player in the control of male-male aggression in Drosophila. Mutations in pfs decreased intermale aggressiveness, but did not affect locomotor activity, olfactory avoidance response and sexual behaviours. pfs encodes for the evolutionarily conserved molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis 1 protein (Mocs1), which catalyzes the first step in the MoCo biosynthesis pathway. Neuronal-specific knockdown of pfs decreased aggressiveness. By contrast, overexpression of pfs greatly increased aggressiveness. Knocking down Cinnamon (Cin) catalyzing the final step in the MoCo synthesis pathway, caused a pfs-like aggression phenotype. In humans, inhibition of MoCo-dependent enzymes displays anti-aggressive effects. Thus, the control of aggression by Pfs-dependent MoCo pathways may be conserved throughout evolution.","list()","Yong Rao","yong.rao@mgill.a","03 January 2019"

He suggests three criteria for a maintenance mechanism to evaluate data on CaMKII and PKMζ as memory storage molecules: necessity, occlusion, and erasure. Here we show that when the criteria are tested, the results reveal important differences between the molecules. Inhibiting PKMζ reverses established, protein synthesis-dependent late-LTP, without affecting early-LTP or baseline synaptic transmission. In contrast, blocking CaMKII has two effects: 1) inhibiting CaMKII activity blocks LTP induction but not maintenance, and 2) disrupting CaMKII interactions with NMDARs in the postsynaptic density (PSD) depresses both early-LTP and basal synaptic transmission equivalently. To identify a maintenance mechanism, we propose a fourth criterion — persistence. PKMζ increases for hours during LTP maintenance in hippocampal slices, and for over a month in specific brain regions during long-term memory storage in conditioned animals. In contrast, increased CaMKII activity lasts only minutes following LTP induction, and CaMKII translocation to the PSD in late-LTP or memory has not been reported. Lastly, do the PKMζ and CaMKII models integrate the many other signaling molecules important for LTP? Activity-dependent PKMζ synthesis is regulated by many of the signaling molecules that induce LTP, including CaMKII, providing a plausible mechanism for new gene expression in the persistent phosphorylation by PKMζ maintaining late-LTP and memory. In contrast, CaMKII autophosphorylation and translocation do not appear to require new protein synthesis. Therefore, the cumulative evidence supports a core role for PKMζ in late-LTP and long-term memory maintenance, and separate roles for CaMKII in LTP induction and for the maintenance of postsynaptic structure and synaptic transmission in a mechanism distinct from late-LTP.","list()","c(""Todd Charlton Sacktor"", ""André Antonio Fenton"")","""tsaktor@downstate.edu"", ""afenton@nyu.edu""","28 December 2018"

With the progressive and selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, proinflammatory cytokines are elevated in the substantia nigra (SN) of PD patients. Thus, anti-inflammation has become one of the therapeutic strategies of PD. Eriocalyxin B (EriB), a diterpenoid isolated from Isodoneriocalyx, was previously reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. MPTP mouse model and MPP+ cell model were prepared to detect the role of EriB in regulating microglia activation and neuron protection. Midbrain tissue and primary cultured microglia and neuron were used to examine microglia activation and neuron damage by immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, western-blot and Elisa assay. Open field activity test was to evaluate the changes of behavioral activity in MPTP-induced PD mouse model. EriB was efficacious in protecting DA neurons by inhibiting microglia activation in PD mice model. Treatment with EriB led to amelioration of disordered sports of PD mice model, which correlated with reduced microglia-associated inflammation and damaged DA neurons. EriB treatment abolished MPP+ induced microglia activation damages to DA neurons in a microglia and DA neurons co-culture system. The underlying mechanism of EriB-induced protective effects involved inhibition of microglia associated proinflammatory cytokines production through the phenotypic shift of microglial cells as well as activator of transcription and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways. These findings demonstrate that EriB exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects through selective modulation of microglia activation by targeting NF-κB signaling pathways, thus exerting the protective effect against on MPP+-induced DA neurons injury.

The hippocampus and striatum showed the highest conversion ratio. The functional integrity of the blood-brain barrier tested by dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging showed no difference to the control. Lactate was increased in the cortex (p < 0.01) and striatum (p < 0.05), while PDH activity was decreased in the cortex (p < 0.01) and striatum (p < 0.001) and the phosphorylated PDH was increased in the striatum (p < 0.05).

Particularly, plastic changes in intrinsic excitability represent the cellular substrate for spatial memory formation in CA1 pyramidal neurons (CA1-PNs). Here, we report that synaptically activated mGluR5-signaling can modulate the intrinsic excitability of CA1-PNs. Specifically, high-frequency stimulation at CA3-CA1 synapses increased firing rate and advanced spike onset with an improvement of temporal precision. These changes are mediated by mGluR5 activation that induces cADPR/RyR-dependent Ca2+ release in the dendrites of CA1-PNs, which in turn causes an increase in persistent Na+ currents (INa,P) in the dendrites. When group I mGluRs in CA1-PNs are globally activated pharmacologically, afterdepolarization (ADP) generation as well as increased firing rate are observed. These effects are abolished by inhibiting mGluR5/cADPR/RyR-dependent Ca2+ release. However, the increase in firing rate, but not the generation of ADP is affected by inhibiting INa,P. The differences between local and global activation of mGluR5-signaling in CA1-PNs indicates that mGluR5-dependent modulation of intrinsic excitability is highly compartmentalized and a variety of ion channels are recruited upon their differential subcellular localizations. As mGluR5 activation is induced by physiologically plausible brief high-frequency stimulation at CA3-CA1 synapses, our results suggest that mGluR5-induced enhancement of dendritic INa,P in CA1-PNs may provide important implications for our understanding about place field formation in the hippocampus.","c(""mGluR5-depe de t plasticity"", ""Persiste t sodium curre t"", ""CA1 pyramidal euro s"", ""I tri sic excitability"")","c(""Sooyun Kim"", ""Won-Kyung Ho"")","""sooyun.kim@snu.a.kr"", ""wonkyung@snu.a.kr""","09 November 2018"

Its worldwide prevalence is estimated to be 3–5% in children and adolescents. The mainstay treatment for ADHD is stimulant medications (e.g. methylphenidate), which increase synaptic dopamine by directly blocking dopamine transporter (DAT). Although these pharmacological agents are effective, they are often associated with various side effects including risks for future substance use disorders in ADHD patients. Here, we investigated an interaction between DAT and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) as a novel target to develop potential therapeutics for the treatment of ADHD by using an interfering peptide (TAT-DATNT) to dissociate this protein complex. We found that TAT-DATNT promotes locomotor behavior in Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, using in vivo microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography, we found that the disruption of D2R-DAT elevates extracellular dopamine level. More importantly, the interfering peptide, TAT-DATNT, attenuates hyperactivity and improves spontaneous alternation behavior in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) ------ a common animal model of ADHD. This work presents a different means (i.e. other than direct blockade by a DAT inhibitor) to regulate the activity of DAT and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and a potential target site for future development of ADHD treatments.","c(""Dopami e Tra sporter"", ""Spo ta eous Alter atio Behavior (SAB)"", ""Atte tio Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)"", ""Extracellular Dopami e Levels"", ""ADHD Treatme ts"")","Fang Liu","fang.liu@amh.a","09 November 2018"

Primary TBI from blast exposure is commonly characterized by internal injuries, such as vascular damage, neuronal injury, and contusion, without external injuries. Current animal models of blast-induced TBI (bTBI) have helped to understand the deleterious effects of moderate to severe blast forces. However, the neurological effects of mild blast forces remain poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the effects caused by mild blast forces combining neuropathological, histological, biochemical and neurophysiological analysis. For this purpose, we employed a rodent blast TBI model with blast forces below the level that causes macroscopic neuropathological changes. We found that mild blast forces induced neuroinflammation in cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. Moreover, mild blast triggered microvascular damage and axonal injury. Furthermore, mild blast caused deficits in hippocampal short-term plasticity and synaptic excitability, but no impairments in long-term potentiation. Finally, mild blast exposure induced proteolytic cleavage of spectrin and the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator, p35 in hippocampus. Together, these findings show that mild blast forces can cause aberrant neurological changes that critically impact neuronal functions. These results are consistent with the idea that mild blast forces may induce subclinical pathophysiological changes that may contribute to neurological and psychiatric disorders.","c(""Blast-i duced traumatic brai i jury"", ""Neuroi flammatio "", ""Microvascular damage"", ""Axo al swelli g"", ""Short-term plasticity"", ""Calpai "", ""p25"")","James A.

Induction of unilateral vision loss in adult mice, by monocular enucleation (ME), is a validated model for such cross-modal brain plasticity. A delayed whisker-driven take-over of the medial monocular zone of the visual cortex is preceded by so-called unimodal plasticity, involving the potentiation of the spared-eye inputs in the binocular cortical territory. Full reactivation of the sensory-deprived contralateral visual cortex is accomplished by 7 weeks post-injury. Serotonin (5-HT) is known to modulate sensory information processing and integration, but its impact on cortical reorganization after sensory loss, remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we assessed the involvement of 5-HT in ME-induced cross-modal plasticity and the 5-HT receptor (5-HTR) subtype used. We first focused on establishing the impact of ME on the total 5-HT concentration measured in the visual cortex and in the somatosensory barrel field. Next, the changes in expression as a function of post-ME recovery time of the monoamine transporter 2 (vMAT2), which loads 5-HT into presynaptic vesicles, and of the 5-HTR1A and 5-HTR3A were assessed, in order to link these temporal expression profiles to the different types of cortical plasticity induced by ME. In order to accurately pinpoint which 5-HTR exactly mediates ME-induced cross-modal plasticity, we pharmacologically antagonized the 5-HTR1A, 5-HTR2A and 5-HTR3A subtypes. This study reveals brain region-specific alterations in total 5-HT concentration, time-dependent modulations in vMAT2, 5-HTR1A and 5-HTR3A protein expression and 5-HTR antagonist-specific effects on the post-ME plasticity phenomena. Together, our results confirm a role for 5-HTR1A in the early phase of binocular visual cortex plasticity and suggest an involvement of 5-HTR2A and 5-HTR3A but not 5-HTR1A during the late cross-modal recruitment of the medial monocular visual cortex. These insights contribute to the general understanding of 5-HT function in cortical plasticity and may encourage the search for improved rehabilitation strategies to compensate for sensory loss.","c(""Brai plasticity"", ""Visual cortex"", ""Adult mice"", ""Mo ocular e ucleatio "", ""Neuromodulator"", ""Seroto i "")","Lutgarde Arckens","lut.arkens@kuleuven.be","06 November 2018"

Because Caskin1 forms homo-multimers and binds not only CASK but also other neuronal proteins in vitro, it is anticipated to have neural functions; but its exact role in mammals remains unclear. Previously, we showed that the concentration of Caskin1 in the spinal dorsal horn increases under chronic pain. To characterize this protein, we generated Caskin1-knockout (Caskin1-KO) mice and specific anti-Caskin1 antibodies. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that Caskin1 was broadly distributed in the whole brain and spinal cord, and that it primarily localized at synapses. To elucidate the neural function of Caskin1 in vivo, we subjected Caskin1-KO mice to comprehensive behavioral analysis. The mutant mice exhibited differences in gait, enhanced nociception, and anxiety-like behavior relative to their wild-type littermates. In addition, the knockouts exhibited strong freezing responses, with or without a cue tone, in contextual and cued-fear conditioning tests as well as low memory retention in the Barnes Maze test.

Thus, the approach toward Aβ metabolism is considered to play a critical role in the onset and progression of AD. Mounting evidence suggests that lifestyle-related diseases are closely associated with AD, and exercise is especially linked to the prevention and the delayed progression of AD. We previously showed that exercise is more effective than diet control against Aβ pathology and cognitive deficit in AD mice fed a high-fat diet; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. On the other hand, a report suggested that exercise induced expression of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) in the hippocampus of mice through PGC1α pathway. Thus, in the current study, we investigated a possibility that FNDC5 interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and affects Aβ metabolism. As a result, for the first time ever, we found the interaction between FNDC5 and APP, and forced expression of FNDC5 significantly decreased levels of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 secreted in the media. Taken together, our results indicate that FNDC5 significantly affects β-cleavage of APP via the interaction with APP, finally regulating Aβ levels.

However, to date, there are no reports on the association between lncRNA gene variation and the risk of ischemic stroke. Therefore, we assessed the association between H19 and MALAT1 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to ischemic stroke in a northern Chinese Han population. Methods In our study, we genotyped four genetic variations in lncRNA-H19 and -MALAT1 (rs217727, rs2251375, rs619586, and rs3200401) in a case–control study of 567 ischemic stroke patients and 552 control subjects. Results We found that the TT genotype of the rs217727 polymorphism within H19 was significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in our northern Chinese Han population (odds ration (OR) = 1.519, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.072–2.152, p = 0.018). Stratified analysis based on stroke subtype revealed that the increased risk was more evident in small vessel ischemic stroke (OR = 1.941, 95% CI = 1.260–2.992, p = 0.02). Individuals with the TT genotype had a 1.941 times higher risk of small vessel ischemic stroke when compared with the subjects of CC + CT. These correlations remained after adjusting for confounding risk factors of stroke (OR = 1.913, 95% CI = 1.221–2.998, p = 0.005). However, there was no significant association between H19 rs2251375 or MALAT1 rs3200401 and ischemic stroke in either total population analysis or subgroup analysis. Conclusion In conclusion, our findings suggest that the H19 rs217727 gene polymorphism contributes to small vessel ischemic stroke susceptibility in the Chinese Han population and may serve as a potential indicator for ischemic stroke susceptibility.","c(""Ischemic stroke"", ""Ge e varia ts"", ""H19"", ""MALAT1"")","Zhiyi He","hezhiyi1982@163.om","10 October 2018"

Consistently, Shank3 transgenic (TG) mice, which mildly overexpress Shank3 proteins exhibit hyperkinetic behavior and spontaneous seizures. However, the seizure phenotype of Shank3 TG mice has only been investigated in adults of the seizure-sensitive strain FVB/N. Therefore, it remains unknown if spontaneous seizures occur in Shank3 TG mice from the early postnatal stages onward, or even in seizure-resistant strains. Clinically, generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the critical risk factor for epilepsy-associated mortality. However, the potential association between Shank3 overexpression and mortality, at least in mice, has not been investigated in detail. In the present study, we backcrossed Shank3 TG mice in seizure-resistant C57BL/6 J strain and monitored their home-cage activities at 3 weeks of age.

We have identified several mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders with robust molecular and functional defects in the dentate gyrus. Among them, mice lacking Schnurri-2 (Shn2 or HIVEP2) have been proposed as a model of schizophrenia and intellectual disability. Shn2 knockout mice exhibit behavioral abnormalities resembling symptoms of schizophrenia and HIVEP2-related intellectual disability as well as marked functional alterations in the soma and output synapse of the dentate granule cells (GCs). Although robust abnormalities were also observed in the dendritic spine morphology in the GCs, their functional correlates remain unknown. In the present study, we performed electrophysiological analyses of synaptic transmission at the medial perforant path (MPP) input onto the GCs in Shn2 knockout mice. While the basal synaptic efficacy was preserved, short-term synaptic depression induced by paired-pulse or low-frequency stimulation was reduced in the mutant mice. High-frequency tetanic stimulation induced lasting synaptic potentiation in both wild-type and mutant mice. However, the decaying synaptic potentiation shortly after the tetanic stimulation was significantly reduced in the mutant mice. These results indicate that the Shn2 deficiency attenuates bidirectional short-term synaptic plasticity at the MPP-GC synapse, thereby rendering the synapse more static.

Spectral analysis of the EEG was performed for the three states. Nlgn2−/− mice showed more wakefulness and less NREM and REM sleep compared to wild-type (Nlgn2+/+) mice, especially during the dark period. This was accompanied by changes in the number and duration of individual episodes of wakefulness and sleep, indexing changes in state consolidation, as well as widespread changes in EEG spectral activity in all states. Abnormal ‘hypersynchronized’ EEG events have also been observed predominantly in Nlgn2−/− mice. These events were mainly observed during wakefulness and REM sleep. In addition, Nlgn2−/− mice showed alterations in the daily time course of NREM sleep delta (1–4 Hz) activity, pointing to modifications in the dynamics of sleep homeostasis.

Thus, we investigated the effects of CBD on three animal models in which NMDAR overactivity plays a critical role: opioid analgesia attenuation, NMDA-induced convulsive syndrome and ischemic stroke. In an in vitro assay, CBD disrupted the regulatory association of σ1R with the NR1 subunit of NMDAR, an effect shared by σ1R antagonists, such as BD1063 and progesterone, and prevented by σ1R agonists, such as 4-IBP, PPCC and PRE084. The in vivo administration of CBD or BD1063 enhanced morphine-evoked supraspinal antinociception, alleviated NMDA-induced convulsive syndrome, and reduced the infarct size caused by permanent unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion. These positive effects of CBD were reduced by the σ1R agonists PRE084 and PPCC, and absent in σ1R−/− mice. Thus, CBD displays antagonist-like activity toward σ1R to reduce the negative effects of NMDAR overactivity in the abovementioned experimental situations.","c(""Ca abidiol"", ""Ca abi oids"", ""Sigma 1 receptor"", ""NMDA receptor"", ""Neuropathology"", ""Epilepsy"", ""Acute pai "", ""Stroke"")","Pilar Sánchez-Blázquez","psb@ajal.si.es","17 September 2018"

Recently, SIRT proteins, including SIRT6, have been reported to be important in learning and memory. However, the role of SIRT6 in excitatory brain neurons in cognitive behaviors is not well characterized. We investigated how cognitive behaviors are affected by genetic SIRT6 depletion in excitatory neurons in the mouse forebrain. We generated a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse line by mating two transgenic lines, Floxed SIRT6 and CaMKIIa-Cre. SIRT6 was thus deleted by Cre recombinase in CaMKIIa-expressing excitatory neurons. We performed cognitive behavioral tests, focusing on learning and memory, including contextual fear conditioning and Morris-water maze. The freezing level of SIRT6 cKO before the fear conditioning was comparable to that of wild-type littermate controls, while the freezing level after the conditioning was higher in SIRT6 cKO mice. In contrast, the mice showed normal spatial learning and memory in the Morris-water maze. In addition, anxiety and locomotion were also normal in SIRT6 cKO mice. SIRT6 genetic depletion enhanced contextual fear memory without affecting spatial memory. Since a previous report showed that overexpression of SIRT6 reduced contextual fear memory, our results suggest that the expression level of SIRT6 bi-directionally regulates contextual fear memory in mice.","c(""Sirtui "", ""SIRT6"", ""Behavior"", ""Lear i g"", ""Spatial memory"", ""Co textual fear memory"")","Bong-Kiun Kaang","kaang@snu.a.kr","06 September 2018"

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) combined with Sanger sequencing could help to understand the genetic diversity and underlying disease mechanisms in pediatric epilepsy. Here, we report sequencing results from a cohort of 172 refractory epilepsy patients aged 0–14 years. The pathogenicity of identified variants was evaluated in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria. We identified 43 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 40 patients (23.3%). Among these variants, 74.4% mutations (32/43) were de novo and 60.5% mutations (26/43) were novel. Patients with onset age of seizures ≤12 months had higher yields of deleterious variants compared to those with onset age of seizures > 12 months (P = 0.006). Variants in ion channel genes accounted for the greatest functional gene category (55.8%), with SCN1A coming first (16/43). 81.25% (13/16) of SCN1A mutations were de novo and 68.8% (11/16) were novel in Dravet syndrome. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were found in the KCNQ2, STXBP1, SCN2A genes in Ohtahara syndrome. Novel deleterious variants were also found in West syndrome, Doose syndrome and glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome patients. One de novo MECP2 mutation were found in a Rett syndrome patient. TSC1/TSC2 variants were found in 60% patients with tuberous sclerosis complex patients. Other novel mutations detected in unclassified epilepsy patients involve the SCN8A, CACNA1A, GABRB3, GABRA1, IQSEC2, TSC1, VRK2, ATP1A2, PCDH19, SLC9A6 and CHD2 genes.

However, modeling MCA occlusion (MCAo) in postnatal day 0–7 (P0–7) mouse pups for IPS study has not been accomplished. Here we occluded the dMCA by inducing the accumulation of magnetic particles (MPs) administered through the superficial temporal vein of mice between P0 and P7, which we called neonatal or perinatal SIMPLE (Stroke Induced with Magnetic Particles). SIMPLE produced either permanent or transient occlusion in the dMCA of perinatal and neonatal mice. Permanent MCA occlusion with SIMPLE resulted in cerebral infarction and neuronal death in the brain. SIMPLE can also be used to reliably produce focal ischemic stroke in neonatal or perinatal mouse brains.

In several major model species—most notably Drosophila—neurogeneticists identify and isolate neural circuits with a binary heterologous expression-control system: Gal4–UASG. One limitation of Gal4–UASG is that expression patterns are often too broad to map circuits precisely. To help refine the range of Gal4 lines, we developed an intersectional genetic AND operator. Interoperable with Gal4, the new system’s key component is a fusion protein in which the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 has been replaced with a zinc finger domain with a different DNA-binding specificity. In combination with its cognate binding site (UASZ) the zinc-finger-replaced Gal4 (‘Zal1’) was functional as a standalone transcription factor. Zal1 transgenes also refined Gal4 expression ranges when combined with UASGZ, a hybrid upstream activation sequence. In this way, combining Gal4 and Zal1 drivers captured restricted cell sets compared with single drivers and improved genetic fidelity. This intersectional genetic AND operation presumably derives from the action of a heterodimeric transcription factor: Gal4-Zal1.

They pump out three sodium ions in exchange for two extracellular potassium ions to establish a cellular electrochemical gradient important for firing of neuronal and cardiac action potentials. We hypothesized that myosin (myo or myh) motor proteins might interact with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits in order for them to play an important role in the transport and trafficking of sodium pump. To this end immunoassays were performed to determine whether class II non-muscle myosins (i.e., NMHC-IIA/myh9, NMHC-IIB/myh10 or NMHC-IIC/myh14), myosin Va (myoVa) and myosin VI (myoVI) would interact with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits. Immunoprecipitation of myh9, myh10, myh14, myoVa and myoVI from rat brain tissues led to the co-immunoprecipitation of Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits expressed there. Heterologous expression studies using HEK293 cells indicated that recombinant myh9, myh10, myh14 and myoVI interact with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits expressed in HEK293 cells. Additional results indicated that loss of tail regions in recombinant myh9, myh10, myh14 and myoVI did not affect their interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits. However, recombinant myh9, myh10 and myh14 mutants having reduced or no actin binding ability, as a result of loss of their actin binding sites, displayed greatly reduced or null interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits. These results suggested the involvement of the actin binding site, but not tail regions, of NMHC-IIs in their interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunits.

These structural characteristics help in identifying the activity state of the neuron and should be taken into consideration when interpreting ultrastructural features of the neurons. Here in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures where experimental conditions can be easily manipulated, two additional features are documented in forebrain neurons as reliable benchmarks for stimulation-induced structural changes: (1) The neuronal nucleus showed conspicuous clustering of dark chromatin, and (2) the endoplasmic reticulum formed stacks with a uniform gap of ~ 13 nm filled with dark materials. Both structural changes progressed with time and were reversible upon returning the slice cultures to control medium. These stimulation-induced structural changes were also verified in dissociated hippocampal neuronal cultures and perfusion-fixed brains. In hippocampal slice cultures, the neuronal chromatin clustering was detectable within 30 s of depolarization with high K+ (90 mM) or treatment with NMDA (50 μM). In contrast, the formation of ER cisternal stacks did not become apparent for another 30 s. Importantly, in dissociated neuronal cultures, when the extracellular calcium was chelated by EGTA, treatment with high K+ no longer induced these changes. These results indicate that the stimulation-induced chromatin clustering and formation of ER stacks in neurons are calcium-dependent. Additionally, mitochondria in neuronal somas of tissue culture samples consistently became swollen upon stimulation. However, swollen mitochondria were also present in some neurons of control samples, but could be eliminated by blocking basal activity or calcium influx. This calcium-dependent structural change of mitochondria is specific to neurons. These structural changes may bring insights to the neuron’s response to intracellular calcium rise upon stimulation.","c(""Electro microscopy"", ""ER"", ""Calcium regulatio "", ""Chromati "", ""Nucleus"")","Jung-Hwa Tao-Cheng","hengs@ninds.nih.gov","27 July 2018"

The post-transcriptional control of NF transcripts is critical for regulating normal levels of NF proteins. Previously, we showed that miRNAs that are dysregulated in ALS spinal cord regulate the levels of NEFL mRNA. In order to complete the understanding of altered NF expression in ALS, in this study we have investigated the regulation of NEFM and NEFH mRNA levels by miRNAs. We observed that a small group of ALS-linked miRNAs that are expressed in human spinal motor neurons directly regulate NEFM and NEFH transcript levels in a manner that is associated with an increase in NFM and NFH protein levels in ALS spinal cord homogenates. In concert with previous observations demonstrating the suppression of NEFL mRNA steady state levels in ALS, these observations provide support for the hypothesis that the dysregulation of miRNAs in spinal motor neurons in ALS fundamentally alters the stoichiometry of NF expression, leading to the formation of pathological NCIs.","c(""ALS"", ""miRNA"", ""Motor euro "", ""Neurofilame t"", "" NEFM "", "" NEFH "")","Michael J.

PPI is measured to assess sensorimotor gating across species, including humans and rodents. Reduced PPI, which is thought to reflect dysfunction of sensorimotor gating, is reported in patients with psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and in animal models of these disorders. Individual differences in basal startle reactivity occur even in a genetically homogenous group of animals; however, there is limited information regarding whether basal levels of the startle response are associated with variations in PPI levels. Here, to explore the relationship between an acoustic startle response (ASR) and PPI, we performed a meta-analysis of data obtained from more than 1300 C57BL/6J male mice on the influence of an ASR to 110- and 120-dB startle stimuli on the PPI levels of the ASR at 74- and 78-dB prepulse intensities. Examination of scatter plots of the ASR amplitudes and PPI levels followed by correlation analyses indicated that there is no simple linear relationship between the two measures; when mice were divided into three groups on the basis of their startle amplitudes, there were positive correlations between the amplitude of the ASR to the 110-dB stimulus and PPI levels in a group of mice that showed lower ASR amplitudes among the genetically homogenous group, whereas no significant correlations were identified in groups of mice that showed intermediate and higher ASR amplitudes. As indicated by the correlation analysis, the lowest responders to the 110-dB stimulus exhibited lower levels of PPI than the intermediate or higher responders. In contrast, for the 120-dB stimulus, a negative correlation was identified between the amplitude of the ASR to the 120-dB stimulus and the PPI levels in the groups of mice that showed intermediate or higher ASR amplitudes. Lower and intermediate responders showed higher levels of PPI than higher responders to the 120-dB stimulus. These findings suggest that basal startle reactivity may affect PPI levels in male C57BL/6J mice, thus representing one potential confounding factor that may confuse the interpretation of PPI results. These findings emphasize the importance of careful examination of startle reactivity to ensure a reliable assessment of PPI.","c(""Acoustic startle respo se"", ""Prepulse i hibitio "", ""Meta-a alysis"", ""Behavioral test battery"", ""Mouse phe otype database"")","Tsuyoshi Miyakawa","miyakawa@fujita-hu.a.jp","13 July 2018"

The percentages of neurons with strong immunoreactivity of TRAAK, TREK-1 and TREK-2 channels were 27, 23, and 20%, respectively.

We showed that stimulation with IL-1β increased expression levels of neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and neurogenin 1 (Ngn1) and promoted neurite outgrowth. We also found that IL-1β increased mRNA and protein levels of Wnt5a. Knockdown of Wnt5a by transfection with Wnt5a siRNA inhibited IL-1β-induced neuronal differentiation.

Corticosterone treatment of mouse hippocampal neurons in vitro caused neurotoxicity with an increase in the markers of autophagy but not apoptosis. Corticosterone treatment impaired insulin signaling from early time points. As an in vivo model of stress, mice were subjected to chronic restraint stress. The chronic restraint stress group showed downregulated insulin signaling and suffered deficits in spatial working memory and nesting behavior.

Generally MHC-I is not expressed on healthy post-mitotic neurons in the central nervous system, but it is known to increase upon immune activation such as viral infections and also during neurodegenerative processes. MHC-I expression is known to be regulated by the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in non-neuronal cells. Interestingly DNMT1 expression is high in neurons despite these being non-dividing. This suggests a role for DNMT1 in neurons beyond the classical re-methylation of DNA after cell division. We thus investigated whether DNMT1 regulates MHC-I in post-mitotic neurons. For this we used primary cultures of mouse cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Our results showed that knockdown of DNMT1 in CGNs caused upregulation of some, but not all subtypes of MHC-I genes. This effect was synergistically enhanced by subsequent IFNγ treatment. Overall MHC-I protein level was not affected by knockdown of DNMT1 in CGNs. Instead our results show that the relative MHC-I expression levels among the different MHC subtypes is regulated by DNMT1 activity. In conclusion, we show that while the mouse H2-D1/L alleles are suppressed in neurons by DNMT1 activity under normal circumstances, the H2-K1 allele is not. This finding is particularly important in two instances. One: in the context of CNS autoimmunity with epitope presentation by specific MHC-I subtypes where this allele specific regulation might become important; and two: in amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS) where H2-K but not H2-D protects motor neurons from ALS astrocyte-induced toxicity in a mouse model of ALS.","c(""MHC class I"", ""Post mitotic euro s"", ""DNMT1"", ""HLA"", ""H2"", ""Autoimmu e eurodege eratio "")","Birgitte Rahbek Kornum","kornum@sund.ku.dk","03 July 2018"

The analgesic effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and the morphine-associated increase in NMDA receptor activation suggest potential role of NMDA receptor in the spinal itch sensation. Male C57BL/6 mice were given intrathecal morphine to induce scratching behavior. The effects of NMDA, ketamine, ifenprodil and U0126 on morphine-induced pruritus and analgesia were evaluated also. The number of scratching responses was counted for 30 min post-injection to evaluate pruritus. A warm-water tail immersion assay was conducted before and until 120 min post-injection at 30-min intervals. Percent of maximal possible effect (%MPE) and area under curve (AUC) were calculated based on tail-flick latency to evaluate analgesic efficacy. Compared with control treatment, intrathecal morphine elicited an obvious scratching response and analgesic effect in a dose dependent manner.

Here, we established a mouse model of drowsiness, where mice are fasted for 1 day and then allowed to overeat high-fat food (to promote sleep) while positioned in an open-field box (to promote vigilance). They fall into a long-lasting drowsy state, as reflected by repeated and open-eyed nodding of the head while in a standing position. Simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and neck electromyogram (EMG) readouts revealed that this drowsy state including nodding state had multiple stages in terms of the relationship between the level of vigilance and head movement: delta oscillations decreased in power prior to the head-nodding period and increased during the non-nodding period. Cav3.1-knockout mice, which have reduced delta oscillations, showed frequent head nodding with reduced duration of nodding episodes compared to wild-type mice. This suggests that the balance of drive is tilted in favor of wakefulness, likely due to their previously proposed decrease in sleep-promoting functions.

Recent studies have shown that mutations in SQSTM1 are linked to ALS. SQSTM1 encodes SQSTM1/p62 that regulates not only autophagy via the association with MAP1LC3/LC3 and ubiquitinated proteins but also the KEAP1-NFE2L2/Nrf2 anti-oxidative stress pathway by interacting with KEAP1. Previously, we have demonstrated that loss of SQSTM1 exacerbates disease phenotypes in a SOD1H46R-expressing ALS mouse model. To clarify the effects of SQSTM1 overexpression in this model, we generated SQSTM1 and SOD1H46R double-transgenic (SQSTM1;SOD1H46R) mice. SQSTM1;SOD1H46R mice exhibited earlier disease onset and shorter lifespan than did SOD1H46R mice. Conversely, disease progression after the onset rather slightly but significantly slowed in SQSTM1;SOD1H46R mice. However, there were observable differences neither in the number of Nissl positive neurons nor in the distribution of ubiquitin-positive and/or SQSTM1-positive aggregates between SOD1H46R and SQSTM1;SOD1H46R mice. It was noted that these protein aggregates were mainly observed in neuropil, and partly localized to astrocytes and/or microglia, but not to MAP2-positive neuronal cell bodies and dendrites at the end-stage of disease. Nonetheless, the biochemically-detectable insoluble SQSTM1 and poly-ubiquitinated proteins were significantly and progressively increased in the spinal cord of SQSTM1;SOD1H46R mice compared to SOD1H46R mice.

Despite the fact that increased α-SYN levels are considered one of the key contributors in developing PD, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of α-SYN still needs to be elucidated. Since the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have important roles in translation, localization, and stability of mRNAs through RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), it is important to identify the exact length of 3′UTRs of transcripts in order to understand the precise regulation of gene expression. Currently annotated human α-SYN mRNA has a relatively long 3′UTR (2529 nucleotides [nt]) with several isoforms. RNA-sequencing and epigenomics data have suggested, however, the possible existence of even longer transcripts which extend beyond the annotated α-SYN 3′UTR sequence. Here, we have discovered the novel extended form of α-SYN 3′UTR (3775 nt) in the substantia nigra of human postmortem brain samples, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons, and other human neuronal cell lines. Interestingly, the longer variant reduced α-SYN translation. The extended α-SYN 3′UTR was significantly lower in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from sporadic PD patients than controls. On the other hand, α-SYN protein levels were much higher in PD cases, showing the strong negative correlation with the extended 3′UTR.

Restoring the feeding pattern is sufficient to prevent HFD-induced obesity in mice. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying HFD-induced feeding pattern disturbances remain elusive. Saturated fatty acids activate microglia and cause hypothalamic inflammation. Activated microglia cause neuroinflammation, which spreads via inflammatory cytokines and gap-junction hemichannels. However, the role of gap-junction hemichannels in HFD-induced obesity remains unaddressed. We used a novel, central-acting connexin inhibitor, INI-0602, which has high affinity for gap junction hemichannels and does not affect the induction of inflammatory cytokines. We analyzed ad libitum feeding behavior and locomotor activity in mice that were fed normal chow (NC), a HFD with elevated saturated fatty acids (SFAs), or a HFD with very high SFAs. We found that HFD feeding induced acute hyperphagia, mainly during the light cycle. Feeding pattern disturbances were more pronounced in mice that consumed the HFD with very high SFAs than in mice that consumed the HFD with elevated SFAs. When INI-0602 was administered before the HFD was introduced, it blocked the feeding pattern disturbance, but not locomotor activity disturbances; moreover, it prevented subsequent diet-induced obesity. However, when INI-0602 was administered after the HFD had disturbed the feeding pattern, it failed to restore the normal feeding pattern. Therefore, we propose that SFAs in HFDs played a major role in disrupting feeding patterns in mice. Moreover, the feeding pattern disturbance required the function of central, gap junction hemichannels at the initiation of a HFD. However, altering hemichannel function after the feeding pattern disturbance was established had no effect. Thus, preventing the occurrence of a feeding pattern disturbance by blocking the hemichannel pathway was associated with the prevention of the HFD-induced obesity in mice.","c(""Diet-i duced obesity"", ""Feedi g clock"", ""Feedi g rhythm"", ""Gap ju ctio "", ""Hyperphagia"", ""Hypothalamic i flammatio "", ""Microglia"", ""Saturated fatty acids"")","Tsutomu Sasaki","tsutomus@gunma-u.a.jp","24 May 2018"

We recently demonstrated the development of an ectopic cortical mass (ECM), which resembles the human subcortical band heterotopia, in the dorsal telencephalon-specific Rapgef2 conditional knockout (Rapgef2-cKO) brains. Additional knockout of Rapgef6 in Rapgef2-cKO mice resulted in gross enlargement of the ECM whereas knockout of Rapgef6 alone (Rapgef6-KO) had no discernible effect on the brain morphology. Here, we performed a battery of behavioral tests to examine the effects of Rapgef2 or Rapgef6 deficiency on higher brain functions. Rapgef2-cKO mice exhibited hyperlocomotion phenotypes. They showed decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and the open-field tests as well as increased depression-like behavior in the Porsolt forced swim and tail suspension tests. They also exhibited increased sociability especially in novel environments. They showed defects in cognitive function as evidenced by reduced learning ability in the Barnes circular maze test and by impaired working memory in the T maze tests. In contrast, although Rapgef6 and Rapgef2 share similarities in biochemical roles, Rapgef6-KO mice exhibited mild behavioral abnormalities detected with a number of behavioral tests, such as hyperlocomotion phenotype in the open-field test and the social interaction test with a novel environment and working-memory defects in the T-maze test. In conclusion, although there were differences in their brain morphology and the magnitude of the behavioral abnormalities, Rapgef2-cKO mice and Rapgef6-KO mice exhibited hyperlocomotion phenotype and working-memory defect, both of which could be recognized as schizophrenia-like behavior.","c(""Rap small GTPases"", ""Gua i e ucleotide excha ge factors"", ""Rapgef2"", ""Rapgef6"", ""Behavioral a alysis"", ""Schizophre ia"")","Tohru Kataoka","kataoka@people.kobe-u.a.jp","10 May 2018"

Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are long-lived, fossorial, eusocial rodents that display remarkable behavioral/cellular hypoxia and hypercapnia resistance. In the central nervous system, ASIC subunit expression is similar between mouse and NMR with the exception of much lower expression of ASIC4 throughout the NMR brain. However, ASIC function and neuronal sensitivity to sustained acidosis has not been examined in the NMR brain. Here, we show with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of cultured NMR and mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons that NMR neurons have smaller voltage-gated Na+ channel currents and more hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials. We further demonstrate that acid-mediated currents in NMR neurons are of smaller magnitude than in mouse, and that all currents in both species are reversibly blocked by the ASIC antagonist benzamil. We further demonstrate that NMR neurons show greater resistance to acid-induced cell death than mouse neurons. In summary, NMR neurons show significant cellular resistance to acidotoxicity compared to mouse neurons, contributing factors likely to be smaller ASIC-mediated currents and reduced NaV activity.","c(""ASIC"", ""Acid-i duced curre ts"", ""Acidotoxicity"", ""Naked mole-rat"", ""Hippocampus"")","Ewan St. John Smith","es336@am.a.uk","09 May 2018"

Genetic deletion or chronic pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 by the negative allosteric modulator CTEP, rescues cognitive function and reduces Aβ aggregation in both APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and 3xTg-AD mouse models of AD. In late onset neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, defects arise at different stages of the autophagy pathway. Here, we show that mGluR5 cell surface expression is elevated in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and 3xTg-AD mice. This is accompanied by reduced autophagy (accumulation of p62) as the consequence of increased ZBTB16 expression and reduced ULK1 activity, as we have previously observed in Huntington’s disease (HD). The chronic (12 week) inhibition of mGluR5 with CTEP in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and 3xTg-AD mice prevents the observed increase in mGluR5 surface expression. In addition, mGluR5 inactivation facilitates the loss of ZBTB16 expression and ULK1 activation as a consequence of ULK-Ser757 dephosphorylation, which promotes the loss of expression of the autophagy marker p62. Moreover, the genetic ablation of mGluR5 in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice activated autophagy via similar mechanisms to pharmacological blockade. This study provides further evidence that mGluR5 overactivation contributes to inhibition of autophagy and can result in impaired clearance of neurotoxic aggregates in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it provides additional support for the potential of mGluR5 inhibition as a general therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and HD.","c(""GPCR"", ""mGluR5"", ""Alzheimer’s disease"", ""APPswe/PS1ΔE9"", ""3xTg-AD"", ""CTEP"", ""ULK1"", ""ZBTB16"", ""Autophagy"")","Stephen S.

Stimulation of regions contiguous to the substantia nigra as well as dopamine (DA) agonists have been shown to be able to attenuate depression. Therefore, since PD causes depletion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, depression, rather than being just a simple mood disorder, may be part of the pathophysiological process that leads to PD. It is plausible that the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways that mediate mood, emotion, and/or cognitive function may also play a key role in depression associated with PD. Here, we propose that a medication designed to address a deficiency in serotonin is more likely to influence motor symptoms of PD associated with depression. This review highlights the effects of an antidepressant, Fluvoxamine maleate, in an animal model that combines depressive-like symptoms and Parkinsonism.","c(""Early stress"", ""Depressio "", ""Dopami e"", ""Fluvoxami e maleate"", ""Parki so ’s disease"")","Ernest Dallé","dumessherve@yahoo.fr","19 March 2018"

Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining and behavioral tests were used to evaluate the neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic effects of RA. The protein and mRNA levels of RARα, PI3K, Akt, Bad, caspase-3, caspase-8, Bcl-2, Bax, and Bid were measured with western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively.

Additionally, we showed that hippocampal apoptosis was weaker in the VAN group than that in VAD group. Relative to the VAD group, the VAN group also had increased mRNA and protein levels of RARα and PI3K, and upregulated phosphorylated Akt/Bad levels in vivo. In vitro, excessively low or high RA signaling promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, the effects on apoptosis involved the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). These data support the idea that sustained VAD following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) inhibits RARα, which downregulates the PI3K/Akt/Bad and Bcl-2/Bax pathways and upregulates the caspase-8/Bid pathway to influence the MMP, ultimately producing deficits in learning and spatial memory in adolescence.

In this study, we examined TLR4 and its association with autophagic activity using a chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain model in wild-type (WT) and TLR4-knockout (KO) mice. The mice were assigned into four groups: WT-Contralateral (Contra), WT-Ipsilateral (Ipsi), TLR4 KO-Contra, and TLR4 KO-Ipsi. Behavioral and mechanical allodynia tests and biochemical analysis of spinal cord tissue were conducted following CCI to the sciatic nerve. Compared with the Contra group, mechanical allodynia in both the WT- and TLR4 KO-Ipsi groups was significantly increased, and a marked decrease of allodynia was observed in the TLR4 KO-Ipsi group. Although glial cells were upregulated in the WT-Ipsi group, no significant change was observed in the TLR4 KO groups. Moreover, protein expression and immunoreactive cell regulation of autophagy (Beclin 1, p62) were significantly increased in the neurons, but not microglia, of WT-Ipsi group compared with the WT-Contra group.

The molecular changes leading to presynaptic dysfunction caused by sAβ1–42, however, still remains elusive. Recently, we found that sAβ1–42 inhibits chemically induced long-term potentiation-induced synaptogenesis by suppressing the intersynaptic vesicle trafficking through calcium (Ca2+) dependent hyperphosphorylation of synapsin and CaMKIV. However, it is still unclear how sAβ1–42 increases intracellular Ca2+ that induces hyperphosphorylation of CaMKIV and synapsin, and what is the functional consequences of sAβ1–42-induced defects in intersynaptic vesicle trafficking in physiological conditions. In this study, we showed that sAβ1–42elevated intracellular Ca2+ through not only extracellular Ca2+ influx but also Ca2+ release from mitochondria. Surprisingly, without Ca2+ release from mitochondria, sAβ1–42 failed to increase intracellular Ca2+ even in the presence of normal extracellular Ca2+. We further found that sAβ1–42-induced mitochondria Ca2+ release alone sufficiently increased Serine 9 phosphorylation of synapsin. By blocking synaptic vesicle reallocation, sAβ1–42 significantly increased heterogeneity of total synaptic vesicle pool size among synapses.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of resolvin D2 (RvD2), a derivative of ω-3 fatty acids, and its possible advantage on cerebral I/R injury in rats. Cerebral I/R caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) was established in Sprague-Dawley rats. First, in rats fed a regular diet, the MCAO/R stimulus led to a significant decrease in endogenous production of RvD2. Exogenous supply of RvD2 via intraperitoneal injection reversed MCAO/R-induced brain injury, including infarction, inflammatory response, brain edema, and neurological dysfunction. Meanwhile, RvD2 reversed the MCAO/R-induced decrease in the protein level of GPR18, which has been identified as a receptor for RvD2, especially in neurons and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). Furthermore, RvD2 exerted rescue effects on MCAO/R-induced neuron and BMVEC death. Moreover, GPR18 antagonist O-1918 could block the rescue effects of RvD2, possibly at least partially though the GPR18-ERK1/2-NOS signaling pathway. Finally, compared with ω-3 fatty acid supplements, RvD2 treatment had a better rescue effect on cerebral infarction, which may be due to the MCAO/R-induced decrease in 5-lipoxygense phosphorylation and subsequent RvD2 generation. In conclusion, compared with ω-3 fatty acids, RvD2 may be an optimal alternative and complementary treatment for ischemic stroke patients with recanalization treatment.","c(""Ischemic stroke"", ""Cerebral ischemia/reperfusio i jury"", ""Resolvi D2"", ""ω-3 fatty acid"", ""GPR18"", ""Neuro "", ""Brai microvascular e dothelial cell"")","c(""Zhong Wang"", ""Haiying Li"")","""15716201037@163.om"", ""lhy1015@suda.edu.n""","13 February 2018"

However, AD is also characterised by reductions in secreted amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPPα), an alternative cleavage product of APP. In contrast to the neurotoxicity of accumulated Αβ, sAPPα has many neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties. Increasing sAPPα levels has the potential to serve as a therapeutic treatment that mitigates the effects of Aβ and rescue cognitive function. Here we tested the hypothesis that lentivirus-mediated expression of a human sAPPα construct in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1dE9), begun before the onset of plaque pathology, could prevent later behavioural and electrophysiological deficits. Male mice were given bilateral intra-hippocampal injections at 4 months of age and tested 8–10 months later. Transgenic mice expressing sAPPα performed significantly better than untreated littermates in all aspects of the spatial water maze task. Expression of sAPPα also resulted in partial rescue of long-term potentiation (LTP), tested in vitro. These improvements occurred in the absence of changes in amyloid pathology. Supporting these findings on LTP, lentiviral-mediated expression of sAPPα for 3 months from 10 months of age, or acute sAPPα treatment in hippocampal slices from 18 to 20 months old transgenic mice, completely reversed the deficits in LTP.

Inferior colliculus (IC) neurons receive glycinergic and GABAergic inputs, whereas inhibition in hippocampus (HC) predominantly relies on GABA. Astrocytes heterogeneously express neurotransmitter transporters and are expected to adapt to the local requirements regarding neurotransmitter homeostasis. Here we analyzed the expression of inhibitory neurotransmitter transporters in IC and HC astrocytes using whole-cell patch-clamp and single-cell reverse transcription-PCR. We show that most astrocytes in both regions expressed functional glycine transporters (GlyTs). Activation of these transporters resulted in an inward current (IGly) that was sensitive to the competitive GlyT1 agonist sarcosine. Astrocytes exhibited transcripts for GlyT1 but not for GlyT2. Glycine did not alter the membrane resistance (RM) arguing for the absence of functional glycine receptors (GlyRs). Thus, IGly was mainly mediated by GlyT1. Similarly, we found expression of functional GABA transporters (GATs) in all IC astrocytes and about half of the HC astrocytes. These transporters mediated an inward current (IGABA) that was sensitive to the competitive GAT-1 and GAT-3 antagonists NO711 and SNAP5114, respectively. Accordingly, transcripts for GAT-1 and GAT-3 were found but not for GAT-2 and BGT-1. Only in hippocampal astrocytes, GABA transiently reduced RM demonstrating the presence of GABAA receptors (GABAARs). However, IGABA was mainly not contaminated by GABAAR-mediated currents as RM changes vanished shortly after GABA application. In both regions, IGABA was stronger than IGly. Furthermore, in HC the IGABA/IGly ratio was larger compared to IC. Taken together, our results demonstrate that astrocytes are heterogeneous across and within distinct brain areas.

In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic glycolysis consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD.

Moreover, recent studies have suggested distinct roles of calpain 1 and 2 in synaptic plasticity. However, the role of hippocampal calpain in memory processes, especially memory consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction, is still unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated the critical roles of hippocampal calpain in the consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of contextual fear memory in mice. We examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of calpain in the hippocampus on these memory processes, using the N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN; calpain 1 and 2 inhibitor). Microinfusion of ALLN into the dorsal hippocampus impaired long-term memory (24 h memory) without affecting short-term memory (2 h memory). Similarly, this pharmacological blockade of calpain in the dorsal hippocampus also disrupted reactivated memory but did not affect memory extinction. Importantly, the systemic administration of ALLN inhibited the induction of c-fos in the hippocampus, which is observed when memory is consolidated. Our observations showed that hippocampal calpain is required for the consolidation and reconsolidation of contextual fear memory.

We found that glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter for fast synaptic transmission. Excitatory synaptic responses induced by local stimulation were mediated by AMPA and kainate (KA) receptors. As compared with mice, AMPA and KA receptor mediated responses were significantly greater. Interestingly, the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in tree shrews was significantly less than that of mice. Moreover, both the ratio of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the time of 50% decay for fast blockade of NMDA receptor mediated EPSCs were greater in the tree shrew.

Considering such a heterogeneous nature of AD, it would be desirable to develop treatment strategies that can improve memory irrespective of the individual causes. Reducing the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) was shown to enhance long-term memory and synaptic plasticity in naïve mice. Moreover, hyper-phosphorylation of eIF2α is observed in the brains of postmortem AD patients. Therefore, regulating eIF2α phosphorylation can be a plausible candidate for restoring memory in AD by targeting memory-enhancing mechanism. In this study, we examined whether PKR inhibition can rescue synaptic and learning deficits in two different AD mouse models; 5XFAD transgenic and Aβ1–42-injected mice. We found that the acute treatment of PKR inhibitor (PKRi) can restore the deficits in long-term memory and long-term potentiation (LTP) in both mouse models without affecting the Aβ load in the hippocampus.

Substantial evidence suggests that memory involves learning-dependent changes at synapses, a process termed long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, understanding the storages process that underlies LTP may provide insight into how the engram is stored. LTP involves induction, maintenance (storage), and expression sub-processes; special tests are required to specifically reveal properties of the storage process. The strongest of these is the Erasure test in which a transiently applied agent that attacks a putative storage molecule may lead to persistent erasure of previously induced LTP/memory. Two major hypotheses have been proposed for LTP/memory storage: the CaMKII and PKM-zeta hypotheses. After discussing the tests that can be used to identify the engram (Necessity test, Saturation/Occlusion test, Erasure test), the status of these hypotheses is evaluated, based on the literature on LTP and memory-guided behavior. Review of the literature indicates that all three tests noted above support the CaMKII hypothesis when done at both the LTP level and at the behavioral level.

CNVs affect gene expression by altering the genome structure and transposable elements within a region. CNVs are greater than 1 kb in size; hence, CNVs can produce more variation than can individual single-nucleotide variations that are detected by next-generation sequencing. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an α-synucleinopathy adult-onset disorder. Pathologically, it is characterized by insoluble aggregation of filamentous α-synuclein in brain oligodendrocytes. Generally, MSA is sporadic, although there are rare cases of familial MSA. In addition, the frequencies of the clinical phenotypes differ considerably among countries. Reports indicate that genetic factors play roles in the mechanisms involved in the pathology and onset of MSA. To evaluate the genetic background of this disorder, we attempted to determine whether there are differences in CNVs between patients with MSA and normal control subjects. We found that the number of CNVs on chromosomes 5, 22, and 4 was increased in MSA; 3 CNVs in non-coding regions were considered risk factors for MSA. Our results show that CNVs in non-coding regions influence the expression of genes through transcription-related mechanisms and potentially increase subsequent structural alterations of chromosomes.

These alterations involve the regulation of both functional and morphological features of dendritic spines, the principal sites of excitatory synaptic contact. New protein synthesis has been implicated extensively in the functional changes observed following long-term potentiation (LTP), and changes to spine morphology have similarly been documented extensively following synaptic potentiation. However, mechanistic links between de novo translation and the structural changes of potentiated spines are less clear. Here, we assess explicitly the potential contribution of new protein translation under control of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) to LTP-associated changes in spine morphology. Utilizing genetic and pharmacological manipulations of mTORC1 function in combination with confocal microscopy in live dissociated hippocampal cultures, we demonstrate that chemically-induced LTP (cLTP) requires do novo protein synthesis and intact mTORC1 signaling. We observed a striking diversity in response properties across morphological classes, with mushroom spines displaying a particular sensitivity to altered mTORC1 signaling across varied levels of synaptic activity. Notably, while pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 signaling significantly diminished glycine-induced changes in spine morphology, transient genetic upregulation of mTORC1 signaling was insufficient to produce spine enlargements on its own. In contrast, genetic upregulation of mTORC1 signaling promoted rapid expansion in spine head diameter when combined with otherwise sub-threshold synaptic stimulation. These results suggest that synaptic activity-derived signaling pathways act in combination with mTORC1-dependent translational control mechanisms to ultimately regulate changes in spine morphology. As several monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders with links to Autism and Intellectual Disability share a common feature of dysregulated mTORC1 signaling, further understanding of the role of this signaling pathway in regulating synapse function and morphology will be essential in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","c(""Spi e Morphology"", ""Mushroom Spi es"", ""mTORC1 Sig ali g"", ""Spi e Head Diameter"", ""mTORC1 Activity"")","Michael A.

DD mice did not initially exhibit hyperactivity in their home cages, but the animals exhibited hyperactivity several hours after the last L-DOPA injection.

The present study investigated whether spontaneous home cage activity is maintained in DD mice 24–43 h and 72–91 h after the last L-DOPA injection. Spontaneous activity was almost completely suppressed during the light phase of the light/dark cycle in DD mice 24 and 72 h after the last L-DOPA injection.

In this study, we identify miR-194 and miR-b2122 to be significantly down-regulated in sALS patients, and were predicted to regulate TARDBP, FUS/TLS and RGNEF expression. Reporter gene assays and RT-qPCR revealed that miR-b2122 down-regulates the reporter gene through direct interactions with either the TARDBP, FUS/TLS, or RGNEF 3’UTR, while miR-194 down-regulates firefly expression when it contained either the TARDBP or FUS/TLS 3’UTR. Further, we showed that miR-b2122 regulates endogenous expression of all three of these genes in a neuronal-derived cell line. Also, an ALS-associated mutation in the FUS/TLS 3’UTR ablates the ability of miR-b2122 to regulate reporter gene linked to FUS/TLS 3’UTR, and sALS samples which showed a down-regulation in miR-b2122 also showed an increase in FUS/TLS protein expression. Overall, we have identified a novel miRNA that is down-regulated in sALS that appears to be a central regulator of disease-related RNA-binding proteins, and thus its dysregulation likely contributes to TDP-43, FUS/TLS and RGNEF pathogenesis in sALS.","c(""Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)"", ""Motor euro "", ""miRNAs"", ""TDP-43"", ""FUS/TLS"", ""RGNEF"", ""mRNA stability"", ""MotomiRs"", ""Neurodege eratio "")","Zachary C.

Olsen"", ""Jing Liang"")","https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-017-0325-8","GABAergic inhibitory transmission is involved in the acute and chronic effects of ethanol on the brain and behavior. One-dose ethanol exposure induces transient plastic changes in GABAA receptor subunit levels, composition, and regional and subcellular localization. Rapid down-regulation of early responder δ subunit-containing GABAA receptor subtypes mediating ethanol-sensitive tonic inhibitory currents in critical neuronal circuits corresponds to rapid tolerance to ethanol’s behavioral responses. Slightly slower, α1 subunit-containing GABAA receptor subtypes mediating ethanol-insensitive synaptic inhibition are down-regulated, corresponding to tolerance to additional ethanol behaviors plus cross-tolerance to other GABAergic drugs including benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and neurosteroids, especially sedative-hypnotic effects. Compensatory up-regulation of synaptically localized α4 and α2 subunit-containing GABAA receptor subtypes, mediating ethanol-sensitive synaptic inhibitory currents follow, but exhibit altered physio-pharmacology, seizure susceptibility, hyperexcitability, anxiety, and tolerance to GABAergic positive allosteric modulators, corresponding to heightened alcohol withdrawal syndrome. All these changes (behavioral, physiological, and biochemical) induced by ethanol administration are transient and return to normal in a few days. After chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment the same changes are observed but they become persistent after 30 or more doses, lasting for at least 120 days in the rat, and probably for life. We conclude that the ethanol-induced changes in GABAA receptors represent aberrant plasticity contributing critically to ethanol dependence and increased voluntary consumption. We suggest that the craving, drug-seeking, and increased consumption in the rat model are tied to ethanol-induced plastic changes in GABAA receptors, importantly the development of ethanol-sensitive synaptic GABAA receptor-mediating inhibitory currents that participate in maintained positive reward actions of ethanol on critical neuronal circuits. These probably disinhibit nerve endings of inhibitory GABAergic neurons on dopamine reward circuit cells, and limbic system circuits mediating anxiolysis in hippocampus and amygdala. We further suggest that the GABAA receptors contributing to alcohol dependence in the rat and presumably in human alcohol use disorders (AUD) are the ethanol-induced up-regulated subtypes containing α4 and most importantly α2 subunits. These mediate critical aspects of the positive reinforcement of ethanol in the dependent chronic user while alleviating heightened withdrawal symptoms experienced whenever ethanol is absent. The speculative conclusions based on firm observations are readily testable.","c(""GABAA receptors"", ""Rode t model of alcoholism"", ""Chro ic i termitte t etha ol"", ""I hibitory sy aptic plasticity"")","Richard W.

Although many victims are initially resuscitated, they often suffer from serious brain injury, even leading to a “persistent vegetative state”. Therefore, it is need to explore therapies which restore and protect brain function after cardiac arrest. In the present study, using Tg (HuC:GCaMP5) zebrafish as a model, we found the zebrafish brain generated a burst of Ca2+ wave after cardiac arrest by in vivo time-lapse confocal imaging. The Ca2+ wave was firstly initiated at hindbrain and then sequentially propagated to midbrain and telencephalon, the neuron displayed Ca2+ overload after Ca2+ wave propagation. Consistent with this, our study further demonstrated neuronal apoptosis was increased in cardiac arrest zebrafish by TUNEL staining. The cardiac arrest-induced Ca2+ wave propagation can be prevented by general anesthetics such as midazolam or ketamine pretreatment. Moreover, midazolam or ketamine pretreatment dramatically decreased the neuronal apoptosis and improved the survival rate in CA zebrafish.

Glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane into the synaptic cleft. Across the synaptic cleft glutamate binds to both ion channels and metabotropic glutamate receptors at the postsynapse, which expedite downstream signalling in the neuron. The postsynaptic density, a highly specialized matrix, which is attached to the postsynaptic membrane, controls this downstream signalling. The postsynaptic density also resets the synapse after each synaptic firing. It is composed of numerous proteins including a family of Discs large associated protein 1, 2, 3 and 4 (DLGAP1-4) that act as scaffold proteins in the postsynaptic density. They link the glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane to other glutamate receptors, to signalling proteins and to components of the cytoskeleton. With the central localisation in the postsynapse, the DLGAP family seems to play a vital role in synaptic scaling by regulating the turnover of both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in response to synaptic activity.

The electrical current excites thalamocortical activity which is controlled by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus (nRT). Previous studies showed that enhancing GABAergic inhibitory strength in the nRT reduces the duration and power of seizures, indicating that the thalamus plays an important role in modulating cortical seizures. The aim of the present study was to apply optogenetics to study the role of the nRT in modulating cortical seizures. We used PV-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mice from Jackson Laboratories, in which only Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is expressed in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Cortical seizure-like activity was induced by electrical stimulation of the corpus callosum after applying 4-aminopyridine. ChR2 expression was abundant in the nRT and cerebellum in PV-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mice. Light stimulation in the nRT caused burst firing in regions of the thalamus and nRT in vitro. Multi-unit activity increased during high-frequency (100 and 50 Hz) light stimulation in the S1 region and thalamus in vivo. Corpus callosum stimulation-induced seizure-like activity was effectively suppressed by high-frequency (100 Hz) and long-duration (10 s) light stimulation. The suppressive effects were reversed by applying a GABAB receptor antagonist but not a GABAA receptor antagonist in the cortex. The results indicated that light stimulation affected thalamocortical relay neurons by activating ChR2-expression neurons in the nRT.

We found that both knockdown and overexpression of Moesin led to defects in axon growth and guidance as well as dendritic arborization. Moreover, reduction of Moesin expression or expression of a constitutively active phosphomimetic in the adult Drosophila brain had no effect on short term memory, but prevented long-term memory formation, an effect that was independent of its role in development.

This raised the possibility that endogenous activation of mGlu2 receptors contributes to the pathophysiology of ischemic neuronal damage. Here, we examined this possibility using two models of transient focal ischemia: (i) the monofilament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice, and (ii) the model based on intracerebral infusion of endothelin-1 (Et-1) in rats. Following transient MCAO, mGlu2 receptor knockout mice showed a significant reduction in infarct volume and an improved short-term behavioural outcome, as assessed by a neurological disability scale and the “grip test”. Following Et-1 infusion, Grm2 gene mutated Hannover Wistar rats lacking mGlu2 receptors did not show changes in the overall infarct volume as compared to their wild-type counterparts, although they showed a reduced infarct area in the agranular insular cortex. Interestingly, however, mGlu2 receptor-deficient rats performed better than wild-type rats in the adhesive tape test, in which these rats did not show the laterality preference typically observed after focal ischemia. These findings support the hypothesis that activation of mGlu2 receptors is detrimental in the post-ischemic phase, and support the use of mGlu2 receptor antagonists in the experimental treatment of brain ischemia.","c(""Focal ischemia"", ""mGlu2 receptor"", ""Ge etic deletio "", ""Neuroprotectio "", ""Neurological score"")","Ferdinando Nicoletti","ferdinandonioletti@hotmail.om","18 August 2017"

The two clinical subgroups of Lewy body dementias, namely, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD), are differentiated by the chronology of cognitive symptoms relative to parkinsonism. At present, there remains a debate on whether DLB and PDD are separate disease entities, or fall within the same spectrum of Lewy body dementias. In this study, we compared the detergent-soluble proteome via an 8-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis of pooled lysates from the prefrontal cortex (BA9) of DLB (n = 19) and PDD (n = 21) patients matched a priori for amyloid (total Aβ42) burden, semi-quantitative scores for Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles together with age-matched control (n = 21) subjects. A total of 1914 proteins were confidently identified by iTRAQ (false discovery rate = 0%). None of the proteins showed a significant yet opposite regulation in between DLB and PDD when compared to aged controls in the proteomic data set as well as following immunoblot analysis of the pooled and individual lysates involving all 61 subjects. The postsynaptic protein, synaptopodin (SYNPO) was significantly down-regulated in both DLB and PDD subgroups, suggesting a defective synaptic transmission in the demented patients. In conclusion, the largely similar proteome of DLB and PDD matched for amyloid burden suggests that variations in concomitant AD-related pathology, abnormal post-translational modifications or protein-protein interactions, defective intracellular trafficking or misfolding of proteins could play a part in driving the clinically observed differences between these two subgroups of Lewy body dementias.

Currently, 42 SCA types are known, some of which are caused by CAG repeat expansions, but others are caused by point mutations or deletions. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is caused by missense mutations or deletions in the PRKCG gene, coding for protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ). It is still not well understood how these mutations eventually cause Purkinje cell dysfunction and death. Because PKCγ is a well characterized signaling protein highly expressed in Purkinje cells SCA14 offers the chance to better understand the pathogenesis of Purkinje cell dysfunction and death. Altered biological activity of PKCγ would be the simplest explanation for the disease phenotype. There are indeed indications that the enzymatic activity of mutated PKCγ proteins could be changed. Many mutations found in SCA14 families are located in the regulatory C1B and C1A domain, while a few mutations are also found in the C2 and in the catalytic C3 and C4 domains. For many of these mutations an increased enzymatic activity could be demonstrated in cell-based assays, but it remains unclear whether there is indeed an altered biological activity of the mutated PKCγ proteins within living Purkinje cells. In this study we used the dendritic morphology of developing Purkinje cells to detect increased biological activity of PKCγ after expression of different mutated PKCγ proteins. Our results indicate that two out of three known mutations in the catalytic domain of PKCγ did indeed show increased biological activity. On the other hand, none of the five tested mutations located in the regulatory C1 or the C2 domain showed an increased biological activity. Our findings indicate that SCA14 mutations located in different domains of the PRKCG gene cause SCA14 by different mechanisms and that an increased constitutive activity of PKCγ may be one, but cannot be the only mechanism to cause disease in SCA14.","c(""Spi ocerebellar ataxia type 14"", ""Protei ki ase C gamma"", ""Purki je cell de dritic developme t"")","Etsuko Shimobayashi","etsuko.shimobayashi@unibas.h","24 July 2017"

Therefore, we aimed to identify which constituent(s) of the reward determines reinforcer strength to enable improved standardization of this parameter across laboratories. Male C57BL/6 mice were examined in the touchscreen-based fixed ratio (FR) and progressive ratio (PR) schedules, reinforced with different kinds of milk-based reinforcers to directly compare the incentive values of plain milk (PM, high-calorie: high-fat/low-sugar), strawberry-flavored milk (SM, high-calorie: low-fat/high-sugar), and semi-skimmed low-fat milk (LM, low-calorie: low-fat/low-sugar) on the basis of differences in caloric content, sugar/fat content, and flavor. Use of a higher caloric content reward was effective in increasing operant training acquisition rate. Total trial number completed in FR and breakpoint in PR were higher using the two isocaloric milk products (PM and SM) than the lower caloric LM, with comparable outcomes between PM and SM conditions, suggesting that total caloric content determines reward strength. Analysis of within-session changes in response rate revealed that overall outputs in FR and PR primarily depend on the response rate at the initial phase of a session, which itself was dependent on reinforcer caloric content. Interestingly, the rate of satiation, indicated by decay in response rate within a FR session, was highest when reinforced with SM, suggesting a rapid satiating effect of sugar. The key contribution of reward caloric content to operant performance was confirmed in a multi-laboratory study using the touchscreen 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) reinforced by two isocaloric milk-based liquid rewards with different countries of origin, which yielded consistent performance parameters across sites. Our results indicate that milk-based liquid reinforcer standardization can be facilitated by matching caloric content across laboratories despite regional or national differences in other non-caloric aspects of the reinforcers.","c(""Rei forcer"", ""Opera t behavior"", ""Calories"", ""Touchscree chamber"", ""Sta dardizatio "")","c(""Chul Hoon Kim"", ""Eosu Kim"")","""kimhoon@yuhs.a"", ""kimeosu@yuhs.a""","17 July 2017"

To better understand the role of MGF in the brain, we used transgenic mice that constitutively overexpressed MGF from birth. MGF overexpression significantly increased the number of BrdU+ proliferative cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVG). Although MGF overexpression increased the overall rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis at the proliferation stage it did not alter the distribution of neurons at post-mitotic maturation stages. We then used the lac-operon system to conditionally overexpress MGF in the mouse brain beginning at 1, 3 and 12 months with histological and behavioral observation at 24 months of age. With conditional overexpression there was an increase of BrdU+ proliferating cells and BrdU+ differentiated mature neurons in the olfactory bulbs at 24 months when overexpression was induced from 1 and 3 months of age but not when started at 12 months. This was associated with preserved olfactory function. In vitro, MGF increased the size and number of neurospheres harvested from SVZ-derived neural stem cells (NSCs). These findings indicate that MGF overexpression increases the number of neural progenitor cells and promotes neurogenesis but does not alter the distribution of adult newborn neurons at post-mitotic stages. Maintaining youthful levels of MGF may be important in reversing age-related neuronal loss and brain dysfunction.","c(""Mecha o growth factor (MGF)"", ""Neural stem cells"", ""Neuroge esis"", ""I suli -like growth factor-I (IGF-I)"", ""Neuroprotectio "", ""Agi g"")","Anthony J.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that hemin functions as a TLR2 endogenous agonist, causing proinflammatory astrocyte activation and secondary brain damage after ICH. Hemin administration to the mouse brain striatum induced ICH injury and neurological deficits, however, the brain injury volume and neurological deficits due to hemin injection were significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out (KO) mice. Hemin administration induced neutrophil infiltration and upregulated neutrophil-attracting chemokine and proinflammatory cytokine expression in wild-type (WT) mice; these effects were ameliorated in TLR2 KO mice. Likewise, ICH-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage was also decreased in TLR2 KO mice. This effect was most likely due to reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) activity in the TLR2 KO mice compared to WT mice. In primary astrocytes, hemin directly induced MMP9 activity as well as proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in a TLR2-dependent manner. Finally, hemin-induced MMP9 activity and proinflammatory gene expression were almost completely blocked by TLR2-neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, our data propose that heme released to the brain parenchyma after ICH injury activates TLR2 in astrocytes and induces inflammatory gene expression and BBB damage, which contribute to secondary brain damage after ICH.","c(""Seco dary Brai Damage"", ""Heme Molecule"", ""I duced MMP9 Activity"", ""Hemi Admi istratio "", ""TLR2 Neutralizi g A tibody"")","c(""Ik-Hyun Cho"", ""Sung Joong Lee"")","""ihho@khu.a.kr"", ""sjlee87@snu.a.kr""","24 June 2017"

Conversely, microglia can also assist in brain development, synaptic plasticity and neural repair through the production of neurotrophic factors and clearance of myelin debris. It is now well accepted that the dysfunction of microglia and microglia-induced neuroinflammation are implicated in the occurrence and progression of many neurological diseases. Although the past decade has witnessed major progress in understanding of multi-tasking microglia, what remains largely enigmatic is the relative importance of microglia at different disease stages and how microglia should be targeted for optimal therapeutic efficacy. Notably, microglia depletion through genetic targeting or pharmacological therapies can be viewed as effective tools to stimulate new microglia to repopulate the central nervous system. Microglia depletion and subsequent repopulation at defined stages in various experimental animal model disorders allow us to extend our knowledge of molecular mechanisms, thus holding promise for designing strategies to resolve neuroinflammation and promote recovery.

To provide an adequate plane of surgery, ketamine was co-administered with dexmedetomidine. The apoptotic neurons in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) were quantitated by immunohistochemistry. To explore the effect of neural activity on ketamine-induced apoptosis, the approaches of Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) and an environmental enrichment (EE) were performed. Ketamine-induced apoptosis in S1 is most prominent at postnatal days 5 and 7 (P5 – P7), and becomes insignificant by P12. Physiological and ketamine-induced apoptosis follow similar developmental patterns, mostly comprised of layer V pyramidal neurons at P5 and shifting to mostly layer II to IV GABAergic neurons by P9. Changes in neuronal activity induced by the DREADD system bidirectionally regulated the pattern of ketamine-induced apoptosis, with reduced activity inducing increased apoptosis and shifting the lamination pattern to a more immature form. Importantly, rearing mice in an EE significantly reduced the magnitude of ketamine-induced apoptosis and shifted its developmental pattern to a more mature form. Together, these results demonstrate that lamination pattern and cell-type dependent vulnerability to ketamine-induced apoptosis follow the physiological apoptosis pattern and are age- and activity-dependent.

In the present study, we investigated the role of 5-HT on glutamate neurotransmission in the ACC slices of adult mice.

However, there have been no reports relating the different ApoE isoforms or AD to differential regulation of BDNF. Here we report that in the hippocampal regions of AD patients both prepro-BDNF and pro-BDNF expression showed a 40 and 60% decrease respectively compared to that expression in the hippocampi of age-matched control patients. We further report that ApoE isoforms differentially regulate maturation and secretion of BDNF from primary human astrocytes. After 24 h, ApoE3 treated astrocytes secreted 1.75- fold higher pro-BDNF than ApoE2-treated astrocytes, and ApoE2-treated astrocytes secreted 3-fold more mature-BDNF (m-BDNF) than ApoE3-treated astrocytes.

In addition, prion-like encompasses the release of protein aggregates from brain cells and their uptake by neighbouring cells. In mice, the intracerebral injection of Tau inclusions induced the ordered assembly of monomeric Tau, followed by its spreading to distant brain regions.

The ability of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors to modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission has thus attracted considerable attention for the development of novel antipsychotics. Consisting of eight subtypes classified into three groups based on sequence homology, signal transduction, and pharmacology, the mGlu receptors provide a wide range of targets to modulate NMDAR function as well as glutamate release. Recently, allosteric modulators of mGlu receptors have been developed that allow unprecedented selectivity among subtypes, not just groups, facilitating the investigation of the effects of subtype-specific modulation. In preclinical animal models, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the group I mGlu receptor mGlu5 have efficacy across all three symptom domains of schizophrenia (positive, negative, and cognitive). The discovery and development of mGlu5 PAMs that display unique signal bias suggests that efficacy can be retained while avoiding the neurotoxic effects of earlier compounds. Interestingly, mGlu1 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) appear efficacious in positive symptom models of the disease but are still in early preclinical development. While selective group II mGlu receptor (mGlu2/3) agonists have reached clinical trials but were unsuccessful, specific mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptor targeting still hold great promise. Genetic studies implicated mGlu2 in the antipsychotic effects of group II agonists and mGlu2 PAMs have since entered into clinical trials. Additionally, mGlu3 appears to play an important role in cognition, may confer neuroprotective effects, and thus is a promising target to alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Although group III mGlu receptors (mGlu4/6/7/8) have attracted less attention, mGlu4 agonists and PAMs appear to have efficacy across all three symptoms domains in preclinical models. The recent discovery of heterodimers comprising mGlu2 and mGlu4 may explain the efficacy of mGlu4 selective compounds but this remains to be determined. Taken together, compounds targeting mGlu receptors, specifically subtype-selective allosteric modulators, provide a compelling alternative approach to fill the unmet clinical needs for patients with schizophrenia.","c(""mGlu receptor"", ""Schizophre ia"", ""Allosteric modulator"", ""Sig al bias"", ""Heterodimer"", ""PAM"", ""NAM"", ""Glutamate"")","P.

Altered expression levels are associated with many pathological situations such as depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is also crucial for neuron functions, via binding of glucocorticoid hormones (GCs). GR actions largely overlap those of BDNF. It has been proposed that GR could be a regulator of BDNF expression, however the molecular mechanisms involved have not been clearly defined yet. Herein, we analyzed the effect of a GC agonist dexamethasone (DEX) on BDNF expression in mouse neuronal primary cultures and in the newly characterized, mouse hippocampal BZ cell line established by targeted oncogenesis. Mouse Bdnf gene exhibits a complex genomic structure with 8 untranslated exons (I to VIII) splicing onto one common and unique coding exon IX. We found that DEX significantly downregulated total BDNF mRNA expression by around 30%. Expression of the highly expressed exon IV and VI containing transcripts was also reduced by DEX. The GR antagonist RU486 abolished this effect, which is consistent with specific GR-mediated action. Transient transfection assays allowed us to define a short 275 bp region within exon IV promoter responsible for GR-mediated Bdnf repression.

Peripheral nerve injury, a common cause of neuropathic pain, engages microglia-neuronal signalling which causes disinhibition and facilitated excitation of spinal nociceptive pathways. However, recent literature indicates that the role of microglia in neuropathic pain is sexually dimorphic, and that female pain processing appears to be independent of microglia, depending rather on T cells. Despite this sex difference, pain signalling in the spinal cord converges downstream of microglia, as NMDAR-mediated facilitated excitation in pain transmitting neurons is consistent between males and females.

Despite a long history of clinical use, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Recently, a novel cellular mechanism of antidepressant action has been proposed: the phenotype of mature brain neurons is transformed to immature-like one by antidepressant drug treatments. We show here that electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), an animal model of ECT, causes profound changes in maturation-related phenotypes of neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of adult mice. Single ECS immediately reduced expression of mature neuronal markers in almost entire population of dentate granule cells. After ECS treatments, granule cells showed some of physiological properties characteristic of immature granule cells such as higher somatic intrinsic excitability and smaller frequency facilitation at the detate-to-CA3 synapse. The rapid downregulation of maturation markers was suppressed by antagonizing glutamate NMDA receptors, but not by perturbing the serotonergic system. While single ECS caused short-lasting effects, repeated ECS induced stable changes in the maturation-related phenotypes lasting more than 2 weeks along with enhancement of synaptic excitation of granule cells. Augmentation of synaptic inhibition or blockade of NMDA receptors after repeated ECS facilitated regaining the initial mature phenotype, suggesting a role for endogenous neuronal excitation in maintaining the altered maturation-related phenotype probably via NMDA receptor activation. These results suggest that brief neuronal activation by ECS induces “dematuration” of the mature granule cells and that enhanced endogenous excitability is likely to support maintenance of such a demature state. The global increase in neuronal excitability accompanying this process may be relevant to the high efficacy of ECT.","c(""A tidepressa t"", ""Electroco vulsive seizure"", ""Hippocampus"", ""Maturatio "", ""Gra ule cell"")","c(""Eri Segi-Nishida"", ""Katsunori Kobayashi"")","""eri.segi.nishida@rs.tus.a.jp"", ""kkatsu-tky@umin.a.jp""","02 March 2017"

Protein and RNA aggregates are a hallmark of ALS pathology and are thought to contribute to ALS by impairing axonal transport. Mutations in several genes known to contribute to ALS result in deposition of their protein products as aggregates; these include TARDBP, C9ORF72, and SOD1. In motor neurons, this can disrupt transport of mitochondria to areas of metabolic need, resulting in damage to cells and can elicit a neuroinflammatory response leading to further neuronal damage. Recently, eight independent human genetics studies have uncovered a link between TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) mutations and ALS. TBK1 belongs to the IKK-kinase family of kinases that are involved in innate immunity signaling pathways; specifically, TBK1 is an inducer of type-1 interferons. TBK1 also has a major role in autophagy and mitophagy, chiefly the phosphorylation of autophagy adaptors. Several other ALS genes are also involved in autophagy, including p62 and OPTN. TBK1 is required for efficient cargo recruitment in autophagy; mutations in TBK1 may result in impaired autophagy and contribute to the accumulation of protein aggregates and ALS pathology. In this review, we focus on the role of TBK1 in autophagy and the contributions of this process to the pathophysiology of ALS.","c(""TBK1"", ""Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"", ""ALS"", ""Motor euro disease"", ""Autophagy"", ""Mitophagy"", ""Neuroi flammatio "", ""Sig ali g"", ""Fro totemporal deme tia"", ""FTD"")","Mark O.

Recent evidence suggests that soluble Aβ oligomers elicit neurotoxicity and synaptotoxicity, including tau abnormalities, and play an initiating role in the development of AD pathology. In this study, we focused on the unclarified issue of whether the neurotoxicity of Aβ oligomers is a reversible process. Using a primary neuron culture model, we examined whether the neurotoxic effects induced by 2-day treatment with Aβ42 oligomers (Aβ-O) are reversible during a subsequent 2-day withdrawal period. Aβ-O treatment resulted in activation of caspase-3 and eIF2α, effects that were considerably attenuated following Aβ-O removal. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that Aβ-O induced aberrant phosphorylation and caspase-mediated cleavage of tau, both of which were mostly reversed by Aβ-O removal. Furthermore, Aβ-O caused intraneuronal dislocation of β-catenin protein and a reduction in its levels, and these alterations were partially reversed upon Aβ-O withdrawal. The dislocation of β-catenin appeared to reflect synaptic disorganization. These findings indicate that removal of extracellular Aβ-O can fully or partially reverse Aβ-O-induced neurotoxic alterations in our neuron model. Accordingly, we propose that the induction of neurotoxicity by Aβ oligomers is a reversible process, which has important implications for the development of AD therapies.","c(""Alzheimer’s disease"", ""Amyloid β-protei "", ""Neurotoxicity"", ""Oligomer"", ""Primary euro "", ""Tau"", ""β-cate i "")","Wataru Araki","araki@nnp.go.jp","31 January 2017"

It remains unknown how stress regulates the individual amygdala PNs embedded in distinct microcircuits. Here, by using retrograde tracing and electrophysiological recording in in vitro slices, we explored the modulation of acute immobilization stress (AIS) on the basoamygdala (BA) PNs projecting either to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or elsewhere, which we designated as BA-mPFC and non-BA-mPFC PNs respectively. The results showed that in the control mice, both the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs/sIPSCs) were comparable between these two subsets of BA PNs. The influences of AIS on sEPSCs and sIPSCs were overall similar between the two neuronal populations. It markedly increased the sEPSCs amplitude but left unaltered their frequency as well as the sIPSCs amplitude and frequency. Despite this, several differences emerged between the effects of AIS on the distribution of sEPSCs/sIPSCs frequency in these two groups of BA PNs. Similar changes were also observed in the sEPSCs/sIPSCs of the two PN populations from mice experiencing forced swimming stress. Their intrinsic excitability, on the other hand, was nearly unaltered following AIS.

Here, we exposed mice to IHT protocols, and performed biochemical analyses and microarray analyses regarding their hippocampal samples. In particular, we performed gene ontology (GO)-based microarray analysis to elucidate effects of IHT on hippocampal functioning, which were compared with the effects of various previously-reported experimental conditions on that (ref. Gene Expression Omnibus, The National Center for Biotechnology Information). Our microarray analyses revealed that IHT and aging shared alterations in some common GO, which were also observed with kainic acid treatment, Dicer ablation, or moderate glutamate excess. Mapping the altered genes using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes PATHWAY database indicated that IHT and aging affected several pathways including “MAPK signaling pathway”, “PI3K-Akt signaling pathway”, and “glutamatergic synapse”. Consistent with the gene analyses, in vivo analyses revealed that IHT increased phosphorylated tau, reflecting an imbalance of kinases and/or phosphatases, and reduced proteins relevant to glutamatergic synapses. In addition, IHT increased phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase, indicating involvement of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. Furthermore, IHT mice demonstrated hyperactivity in Y-maze tests, which was also observed in AD models. We obtained important data or something from the massive amount of microarray data, and confirmed the validity by in vivo analyses: the IHT-induced cognitive impairment may be partially explained by the fact that IHT increases phosphorylated tau via biological processes common to aging.

During neural development, the chromatin remodeling factor Chd7 (chromatin helicase-DNA-binding protein 7) is expressed in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon of mouse brain at embryonic day 14.5, as well as in cultured NSPCs. Retroviral overexpression of Pax6 in NSPCs increased Chd7 gene expression. Lentivirally-expressed Chd7 shRNA suppressed cell proliferation and neurosphere formation, and inhibited neurogenesis in vitro, while decreasing gene expression of Hes5 and N-myc. In addition, CHD7 overexpression increased cell proliferation in human embryonic stem cell-derived NSPCs (ES-NSPCs). In Chd7 mutant fetal mouse brains, there were fewer intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) compared to wildtype littermates, indicating that Chd7 contributes to neurogenesis in the early developmental mouse brain. Furthermore, in silico database analysis showed that, among members of the CHD family, CHD7 is highly expressed in human gliomas.

We then went on to assess the functional consequences of these molecular changes, demonstrating that PWS-IC mice are unresponsive to an anorectic doses of a 5-HT2CR agonist and that this is associated with attenuated activation of POMC neurons within the ARC. These data provide new insight into the significance of Htr2c pre-mRNA processing to the physiological regulation of appetite and potentially the pathological manifestation of hyperphagia in PWS. Furthermore, these findings have translational relevance for individuals with PWS who may seek to control appetite with another 5-HT2CR agonist, the new obesity treatment lorcaserin.","c(""S ord115"", ""Prader-Willi sy drome"", ""Seroto i 2C recptor"", ""Alter ate splici g"", ""Feedi g"")","Anthony R.

In addition to its beneficial effects on withdrawal and prevention of relapse, reports of sedation during clinical treatment suggest that arousal networks in the brain may be recruited during Heantos administration. T-type calcium channels are implicated in the generation of sleep rhythms and in this study we examined whether a Heantos-4 extraction modulates T-type calcium channel currents generated by the Cav3.1, Cav3.2 and Ca3.3 subtypes. Utilizing whole-cell voltage clamp on exogenously expressed T-type calcium channels we find that Heantos inhibits Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 currents, while selectively potentiating Cav3.2 currents. We further examined the effects of Heantos-4 extract on low-threshold burst-firing in thalamic neurons which contribute to sleep oscillations. Using whole-cell current clamp in acute thalamic brain slices Heantos-4 suppressed rebound burst-firing in ventrobasal thalamocortical neurons, which express primarily Cav3.1 channels. Conversely, Heantos-4 had no significant effect on the burst-firing properties of thalamic reticular neurons, which express a mixed population of Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 channels. Examining Heantos-4 effects following oral administration in a model of absence epilepsy revealed the potential to exacerbate seizure activity. Together, the findings indicate that Heantos-4 has selective effects both on specific T-type calcium channel isoforms and distinct populations of thalamic neurons providing a putative mechanism underlying its effects on sedation and on the thalamocortical network.","c(""Burst firi g"", ""Thalamocortical"", ""Thalamus"", ""T-type"", ""Calcium"", ""Epilepsy"", ""Addictio "", ""Hea tos-4"")","Terrance P.

To date, only a few patients have been reported worldwide. Their clinical presentation has been remarkably consistent with primary features of severe psychomotor retardation, encephalopathy, hypotonia, and infantile-onset refractory epilepsy. We report a new case of ABAT deficiency that marks an important departure from previous clinical findings. The patient presented at age 6 months with global developmental delay, hypotonia, hypersomnolence and mild choreiform movements. At age 18 months, the subject’s clinical presentation was still milder than all previously reported patients and, most notably, did not include seizures. Clinical whole exome sequencing revealed two heterozygous ABAT missense variants that are rare and predicted damaging, but never before reported in a patient and were reported as variants of unknown significance. To test the potential pathogenicity of the variants identified in this patient we developed a cell-based system to test both functions of the ABAT protein via GABA transaminase enzyme activity and mtDNA copy number assays. This systematic approach was validated using vigabatrin, the irreversible inhibitor of ABAT, and leveraged to test the functionality of all ABAT variants in previously reported patients plus the variants in this new case. This work confirmed the novel variants compromised ABAT function to similar levels as variants in previously characterized cases with more severe clinical presentation, thereby confirming the molecular diagnosis of this patient. Additionally, functional studies conducted in cells from both mild and severe patient fibroblasts showed similar levels of compromise in mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory capacity, ATP production and mtDNA depletion. These results illustrate how cell-based functional studies can aid in the diagnosis of a rare, neurological disorder. Importantly, this patient marks an expansion in the clinical phenotype for ABAT deficiency to a milder presentation that is more commonly seen in pediatric genetics and neurology clinics.","c(""Exome Seque ci g"", ""Vigabatri "", ""Cerebral Spi al Fluid"", ""T98G Cell"", ""GABAT Activity"")","P.

Due to rapidly increasing prevalence in aging society, dementia now confers a major economic, social, and healthcare burden throughout the world, and has therefore been identified as a public health priority by the World Health Organization. Previous studies have established dementia as a ‘proteinopathy’ caused by detrimental changes in brain protein structure and function that promote misfolding, aggregation, and deposition as insoluble amyloid plaques. Despite clear evidence that pathological cognitive decline is associated with degenerative protein modifications (DPMs) arising from spontaneous chemical modifications to amino acid side chains, the molecular mechanisms that promote brain DPMs formation remain poorly understood. However, the technical challenges associated with DPM analysis have recently become tractable due to powerful new proteomic techniques that facilitate detailed analysis of brain tissue damage over time. Recent studies have identified that neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the dysregulation of critical repair enzymes, as well as the misfolding, aggregation and accumulation of modified brain proteins. Future studies will further elucidate the mechanisms underlying dementia pathogenesis via the quantitative profiling of the human brain proteome and associated DPMs in distinct phases and subtypes of disease. This review summarizes recent developments in quantitative proteomic technologies, describes how these techniques have been applied to the study of dementia-linked changes in brain protein structure and function, and briefly outlines how these findings might be translated into novel clinical applications for dementia patients.

In the latter case, a fraction of postsynaptic current would be mediated by cation-selective acid-sensing ion channels. Additionally, in both cases, activation of acid-sensing ion channels could modulate synaptic strength by affecting transmitter release and/or sensitivity of postsynaptic receptors. To address potential involvement of acid-sensing ion channels in mediation/modulation of synaptic transmission at hippocampal GABAergic synapses, we studied effects of three structurally different blockers of acid-sensing ion channels on evoked postsynaptic currents using the patch-clamp technique. We found that GABAergic postsynaptic currents, recorded below their reversal potential as inward currents, are suppressed by all the employed blockers of acid-sensing ion channels. These currents were suppressed by ~ 20 % in the presence of a novel blocker 5b (1 μM) and by ~30 % in the presence of either amiloride (25 μM) or diminazene (20 μM). In the same cells the suppression of postsynaptic currents, recorded above their reversal potential as outward currents was statistically insignificant. These results imply that the effects of blockers in our experiments are at least partially postsynaptic. On the other hand, in the case of mediation of a fraction of postsynaptic current by acid-sensing ion channels, an increase of outward currents would be expected under our experimental conditions. Our analysis of a bicuculline-resistant fraction of postsynaptic currents also suggests that effects of the blockers are predominantly modulatory. In this work we present evidence for the first time that acid-sensing ion channels play a functional role at hippocampal GABAergic synapses. The suppressing effect of the blockers of acid-sensing ion channels on GABAergic transmission is due, at least partially, to a postsynaptic but (predominantly) modulatory mechanism. We hypothesize that the modulatory effect is due to functional crosstalk between ASICs and GABAA-receptors recently reported in isolated neurons, however, verification of this hypothesis is necessary.","c(""Proto s"", ""Sy aptic tra smissio "", ""Amiloride"", ""Dimi aze e"", ""GABA"")","Maksim Storozhuk","maksim@biph.kiev.ua","19 October 2016"

To date, this rich bioresource of LCLs has been underused for generating iPSCs, and its use would greatly expand the range of targeted diseases that could be studied by using patient-specific iPSCs. However, it remains unclear whether patient’s LCL-derived iPSCs (LiPSCs) can function as a disease model. Therefore, we generated Parkinson’s disease patient-specific LiPSCs and evaluated their utility as tools for modeling neurological diseases. We established iPSCs from two LCL clones, which were derived from a healthy donor and a patient carrying PARK2 mutations, by using existing non-integrating episomal protocols. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses showed that the appearance of somatic variations in the genomes of the iPSCs did not vary substantially according to the original cell types (LCLs, T-cells and fibroblasts). Furthermore, LiPSCs could be differentiated into functional neurons by using the direct neurosphere conversion method (dNS method), and they showed several Parkinson’s disease phenotypes that were similar to those of DF-iPSCs. These data indicate that the global LCL repositories can be used as a resource for generating iPSCs and disease models.

We found that acute PERK inhibition by the use of a highly specific PERK inhibitor reduced the intracellular Ca2+ rise stimulated by the activation of acetylcholine, metabotropic glutamate and bradykinin-2 receptors in primary cortical neurons.

In a middle cerebral artery occlusion model (4 h ischemia without reperfusion), hypothermia effectively reduces mean infarct volume. Hypothermia also prevents neurons in the infarct area from releasing high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), the most well-studied damage-associated molecular pattern protein. By preventing its release, hypothermia also prevents the typical middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced increase in serum HMGB1. We also found that both glycyrrhizin-mediated inhibition of HMGB1 and intracerebroventricular neutralizing antibody treatments before middle cerebral artery occlusion onset diminish infarct volume. This suggests a clear neuroprotective effect of HMGB1 inhibition by hypothermia in the brain. We next used real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in peri-infarct regions. Although middle cerebral artery occlusion increases the expression of interleukin-1β and tissue necrosis factor-α, this elevation is suppressed by both hypothermia and glycyrrhizin treatment. We show that hypothermia reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines and helps salvage peri-infarct regions from the propagation of ischemic injury via HMGB1 blockade.

Thus, the mammalian diurnality or nocturnality is likely determined by the differential signaling of prokineticin 2 from the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells onto their retinorecipient brain targets.","c(""Circadia clock output"", ""Wakeful ess"", ""Sleep"", ""Diur al"", ""Noctur al"", ""Proki etici 2"", ""Oscillatio "", ""I tri sically photose sitive reti al ga glio cells"", ""Suprachiasmatic ucleus"", ""Superior colliculus"")","Qun-Yong Zhou","qzhou@ui.edu","18 August 2016"

However, the precise cellular actions of Aβ oligomers and underlying mechanisms in neurons remain to be fully defined. Previous studies have identified mitochondria as a major target of Aβ toxicity contributing to early cognitive decline and memory loss in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this study, we report that Aβ oligomers acutely elicit distinct effects on the transport and integrity of mitochondria. We found that acute exposure of hippocampal neurons to Aβ oligomers from either synthetic peptides or AD brain homogenates selectively impaired fast transport of mitochondria without affecting the movement of late endosomes and lysosomes. Extended exposure of hipoocampal neurons to Aβ oligomers was found to result in mitochondrial fragmentation. While both mitochondrial effects induced by Aβ oligomers can be abolished by the inhibition of GSK3β, they appear to be independent from each other. Aβ oligomers impaired mitochondrial transport through HDAC6 activation whereas the fragmentation involved the GTPase Drp-1. These results show that Aβ oligomers can acutely disrupt mitochondrial transport and integrity in a time-dependent and pathway-specific manner. These findings thus provide new insights into Aβ-induced mitochondrial defects that may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and AD pathogenesis.","c(""Alzheimer’s disease"", ""Tra sport"", ""Fragme tatio "", ""Hippocampus"", ""HDAC6"", ""Drp-1"", ""GSK3β"")","James Q.

The rs6295 risk allele prevents binding of the repressor Deaf1 increasing 5-HT1A receptor gene transcription, and the Deaf1-/- mouse model shows an increase in 5-HT1A autoreceptor expression. In this study, Deaf1-/- mice bred on a mixed C57BL6-BALB/c background were compared to wild-type littermates for 5-HT1A autoreceptor function and behavior in males and females. Despite a sustained increase in 5-HT1A autoreceptor binding levels, the amplitude of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated current in 5-HT neurons was unaltered in Deaf1-/- mice, suggesting compensatory changes in receptor function. Consistent with increased 5-HT1A autoreceptor function in vivo, hypothermia induced by the 5-HT1A agonist DPAT was augmented in early generation male but not female Deaf1-/- mice, but was reduced with succeeding generations. Loss of Deaf1 resulted in a mild anxiety phenotype that was sex-and test-dependent, with no change in depression-like behavior. Male Deaf1 knockout mice displayed anxiety-like behavior in the open field and light-dark tests, while female Deaf1-/- mice showed increased anxiety only in the elevated plus maze. These data show that altered 5-HT1A autoreceptor regulation in male Deaf1-/- mice can be compensated for by generational adaptation of receptor response that may help to normalize behavior.

We have studied the synaptic function and cognition in CD mice using hippocampal slices and a behavioral test sensitive to hippocampal function.

They are all regulated by mechanisms centered around mitochondrion. Type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) enriched on neuronal plasma membrane. Recent evidences point to the substantial presence of CB1 receptors on neuronal mitochondrial outer membranes (mtCB1) and the activation of mtCB1 influences aerobic respiration via inhibiting mitochondrial cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA)/complex I pathway. The expression and role of neuronal mtCB1 under TBI are unknown. Using TBI models of cultured neurons, wild type and CB1 knockout mice, we found mtCB1 quickly upregulated after TBI. Activation of mtCB1 promoted metabolic defects accompanied with ATP shortage but protected neurons from apoptosis. Selective activation of plasma membrane CB1 showed no effects on neuronal metabolism and apoptosis. Activation of mtCB1 receptors inhibited mitochondrial cAMP/PKA/complex I and resulted in exacerbated metabolic defects accompanied with a higher ratio of ATP reduction to oxygen consumption decrease as well as neuronal apoptosis. Further research found the remarkable accumulation of protein kinase B (AKT) on neuronal mitochondria following TBI and the activation of mtCB1 upregulated mitochondrial AKT/complex V activity. Upregulation of mitochondrial AKT/complex V activity showed anti-apoptosis effects and alleviated ATP shortage in metabolic defects. Taken together, we have identified mtCB1 quickly upregulate after TBI and a dual role the mtCB1 might play in metabolic defects and neuronal apoptosis initiated by TBI: the inhibition of mitochondrial cAMP/PKA/complex I aggravates metabolic defects, energy insufficiency as well as neuronal apoptosis, but the coactivation of mitochondrial AKT/complex V mitigates energy insufficiency and neuronal apoptosis.","c(""Apoptosis"", ""Mitocho drial type-1 ca abi oid receptor"", ""Metabolic defects"", ""Traumatic brai i jury"")","Zhen Xu","xuzhenhangzhou@yeah.net","02 August 2016"

Defects in astrocyte signaling are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by abnormal neural circuitry such as Fragile X syndrome (FXS). In animal models of FXS, the loss in expression of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP) from astrocytes is associated with delayed dendrite maturation and improper synapse formation; however, the effect of astrocyte-derived factors on the development of neurons is not known. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an important astrocyte-secreted protein that is involved in the regulation of spine development and synaptogenesis. In this study, we found that cultured astrocytes isolated from an Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mouse model of FXS displayed a significant decrease in TSP-1 protein expression compared to the wildtype (WT) astrocytes. Correspondingly, Fmr1 KO hippocampal neurons exhibited morphological deficits in dendritic spines and alterations in excitatory synapse formation following long-term culture. All spine and synaptic abnormalities were prevented in the presence of either astrocyte-conditioned media or a feeder layer derived from FMRP-expressing astrocytes, or following the application of exogenous TSP-1.

We found that both the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in the ACC were enhanced after the formation of chronic itch. The paired-pulse ratio in ACC neurons recorded from the DCP group were smaller than those recorded in control group at the 50-ms interval. We also observe a significant increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio in the DCP group. Moreover, an increased inward rectification of AMPARs in ACC pyramidal neurons was observed in the DCP group. Interestingly, the calculated ratio of silent synapses was significantly reduced in the DCP group compared with controls.

In this study, we explored the presence and characterized the properties of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in NS20Y cells, a neuronal cell line previously used for the study of neuronal differentiation. In addition, the potential role of ASICs in cell differentiation was explored. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction and Western blot revealed the presence of ASIC1 subunits in these cells. Fast drops of extracellular pH activated transient inward currents which were blocked, in a dose dependent manner, by amiloride, a non-selective ASIC blocker, and by Psalmotoxin-1 (PcTX1), a specific inhibitor for homomeric ASIC1a and heteromeric ASIC1a/2b channels. Incubation of cells with PcTX1 significantly reduced the differentiation of NS20Y cells induced by cpt-cAMP, as evidenced by decreased neurite length, dendritic complexity, decreased expression of functional voltage gated Na+ channels. Consistent with ASIC1a inhibition, ASIC1a knockdown with small interference RNA significantly attenuates cpt-cAMP-induced increase of neurite outgrowth.

The neuromuscular junction is innervated by a single axon at the end of the synapse elimination process and, because of its relative simplicity, has long been used as a model for studying the general principles of synapse development. The involvement of the presynaptic muscarinic ACh autoreceptors may allow for the direct competitive interaction between nerve endings through differential activity-dependent acetylcholine release in the synaptic cleft. Then, the most active ending may directly punish the less active ones.

Persistent pain varies according to its causes, often resulting from local tissue damage or inflammation. Central somatosensory pathway lesions that are not adequately relieved can consequently cause central pain syndrome or central neuropathic pain. Research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie this pathogenesis is important for treating such pain. To date, evidence suggests the involvement of ion channels, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel P2X receptors, in central nervous system pain transmission and persistent modulation upon and following the occurrence of neuropathic pain. Several P2X receptor subtypes, including P2X2, P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7, have been shown to play diverse roles in the pathogenesis of central pain including the mediation of fast transmission in the peripheral nervous system and modulation of neuronal activity in the central nervous system. This review article highlights the role of the P2X family of ATP receptors in the pathogenesis of central neuropathic pain and pain transmission. We discuss basic research that may be translated to clinical application, suggesting that P2X receptors may be treatment targets for central pain syndrome.","c(""Ce tral pai sy drome"", ""Ade osi e triphosphate (ATP)"", ""P2X receptors"")","Bai-Chuang Shyu","bmbai@gate.sinia.edu.tw","26 May 2016"

At least 50 % of HIV diagnosed cases show one or other kind of neuropathological signs or symptoms during different stages of disease progression. In the same line, mild to severe neurological alterations are seen in at least 80 % autopsies of AIDS patients. Neurological illnesses weaken the connections between neurons causing significant altercations in synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity alterations during HIV infection and recreational drug abuse are mediated by complex cellular phenomena involving changes in gene expression and subsequent loss of dendritic and spine morphology and physiology. New treatment strategies with ability to deliver drugs across blood-brain barrier (BBB) are being intensively investigated. In this context, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) based nanoformulations have shown significant potential for target specificity, drug delivery, drug release, and bioavailability of desired amount of drugs in non-invasive brain targeting.

TSC is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which enhance activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Recent studies have suggested that mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin can reverse TSC-associated deficits in rodent models of TSC. In addition, clinical trials are ongoing to test the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors toward the psychiatric symptoms associated with TSC. Here, we report a case study of a Korean patient with TSC, who exhibited multiple symptoms including frequent seizures, intellectual disability, language delays, and social problems. We performed whole exome sequencing and identified a novel small deletion mutation in TSC2. Expressing the novel deletion mutant in HEK293T cells significantly increased mTOR pathway activation. Furthermore, everolimus treatment showed not only reduction in SEGA size, but dramatically improved behavioral deficits including autism related behaviors in the patient. In summary, we identified a novel small deletion mutation in TSC2 associated with severe TSC in a Korean family that enhances the activation of mTOR signaling in vitro.

Adult neurogenesis is controlled at multiple levels, including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and programmed cell death (PCD). Among these, PCD is the last and most prominent process for regulating the final number of mature neurons integrated into neural circuits. PCD can be classified into apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagic cell death and emerging evidence suggests that all three may be important modes of cell death in neural stem/progenitor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate PCD and thereby impact the intricate balance between self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation during adult neurogenesis are not well understood. In this comprehensive review, we focus on the extent, mechanism, and biological significance of PCD for the control of adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain. The role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the regulation of PCD at the molecular and systems levels is also discussed. Adult neurogenesis is a dynamic process, and the signals for differentiation, proliferation, and death of neural progenitor/stem cells are closely interrelated.

Hosts have developed complex immune systems to cope with the danger. Preceding the elimination of pathogens, selective recognition of the non-self invaders is necessary. At the forefront of the body’s defenses are the innate immune cells, which are equipped with particular sensor molecules that can detect common exterior patterns of invading pathogens and their secreting toxins as well as with phagocytic machinery. Inflammatory mediators and cytokines released from these innate immune cells and infected tissues can boost the inflammatory cascade and further recruit adaptive immune cells to maximize the elimination and resolution. The nervous system also seems to interact with this process, mostly known to be affected by the inflammatory mediators through the binding of neuronal receptors, consequently activating neural circuits that tune the local and systemic inflammatory states. Recent research has suggested new contact points: direct interactions of sensory neurons with pathogens. Latest findings demonstrated that the sensory neurons not only share pattern recognition mechanisms with innate immune cells, but also utilize endogenous and exogenous electrogenic components for bacterial pathogen detection, by which the electrical firing prompts faster information flow than what could be achieved when the immune system is solely involved. As a result, rapid pain generation and active accommodation of the immune status occur. Here we introduced the sensory neuron-specific detector molecules for directly responding to bacterial pathogens and their signaling mechanisms. We also discussed extended issues that need to be explored in the future.","c(""Pathoge "", ""Bacteria"", ""Se sory euro "", ""Patter recog itio receptors"", ""TRPA1"", ""ADAM10"", ""FPR"", ""Pai "", ""I flammatio "")","Sun Wook Hwang","sunhwang@korea.a.kr","09 March 2016"

Aβ peptides are generated by cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by the β − and γ − secretase enzymes. Although this process is tightly linked to the internalization of cell surface APP, the compartments responsible are not well defined. We have found that APP can be rapidly internalized from the cell surface to lysosomes, bypassing early and late endosomes. Here we show by confocal microscopy and electron microscopy that this pathway is mediated by macropinocytosis. APP internalization is enhanced by antibody binding/crosslinking of APP suggesting that APP may function as a receptor. Furthermore, a dominant negative mutant of Arf6 blocks direct transport of APP to lysosomes, but does not affect classical endocytosis to endosomes. Arf6 expression increases through the hippocampus with the development of Alzheimer’s disease, being expressed mostly in the CA1 and CA2 regions in normal individuals but spreading through the CA3 and CA4 regions in individuals with pathologically diagnosed AD. Disruption of lysosomal transport of APP reduces both Aβ40 and Aβ42 production by more than 30 %. Our findings suggest that the lysosome is an important site for Aβ production and that altering APP trafficking represents a viable strategy to reduce Aβ production.","c(""Amyloid Precursor Protei "", ""Amyloid Precursor Protei Processi g"", ""SN56 Cell"", ""Fluoresce t Dextra "", ""Arf6 Expressio "")","Stephen H.

Three transcription factors, Foxn4, RORβ1 and their downstream effector Ptf1a, have been shown to be indispensable intrinsic regulators for the differentiation of amacrine and horizontal cells. At present, however, it is unclear how Ptf1a specifies these two cell fates from competent retinal precursors. Here, through combined bioinformatic, molecular and genetic approaches in mouse retinas, we identify the Tfap2a and Tfap2b transcription factors as two major downstream effectors of Ptf1a. RNA-seq and immunolabeling analyses show that the expression of Tfap2a and 2b transcripts and proteins is dramatically downregulated in the Ptf1a null mutant retina. Their overexpression is capable of promoting the differentiation of glycinergic and GABAergic amacrine cells at the expense of photoreceptors much as misexpressed Ptf1a is, whereas their simultaneous knockdown has the opposite effect. Given the demonstrated requirement for Tfap2a and 2b in horizontal cell differentiation, our study thus defines a Foxn4/RORβ1-Ptf1a-Tfap2a/2b transcriptional regulatory cascade that underlies the competence, specification and differentiation of amacrine and horizontal cells during retinal development.","c(""Tfap2"", ""Ptf1a"", ""Fox 4"", ""Amacri e cell"", ""Horizo tal cell"", ""Reti al developme t"")","Mengqing Xiang","xiang@abm.rutgers.edu","13 May 2015"

One of the original hallmarks of AD are plaques comprised of beta amyloid (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of phosphorylated Tau protein. However, it is soluble oligomeric Aβ which is more closely correlated with cognitive decline and is therefore considered to be the neurotoxic species. Oligomeric Aβ has recently been shown to form complexes with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein, cellular prion protein (PrPc), and these complexes are believed to play an important role in the progression of AD pathogenesis. Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter is responsible for mediating learning and memory under normal physiological conditions. However, the dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling has also been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Glutamate acts via both ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), each of which have been implicated in AD. There is now growing evidence to suggest that mGluR5 may contribute the AD pathogenesis by acting as scaffolds for the PrPc/Aβ oligomer complex, enabling the propagation of neurotoxic signaling in AD. In addition, PrPc and Aβ oligomer signaling via NMDARs may also contribute to AD pathology. The current review overviews our current understanding of the role of PrPc and Aβ oligomers in regulating glutamate receptor signaling, as well as highlights the importance of understanding these signaling complexes to develop more effective therapeutic strategies to treat AD.","c(""Alzheimer’s disease"", ""β-amyloid"", ""Cellular prio protei "", ""Glutamate"", ""APPswe/PS1ΔE9"", ""Metabotropic glutamate receptor"", ""NMDA"", ""Neurodege eratio "")","Stephen S G Ferguson","ferguson@robarts.a","24 March 2015"

Thus, not surprising, considerable research effort, both in vivo and in vitro, has been devoted to studying the nervous system and signal transmission through it. However, conventional in vitro cell culture systems do not enable control over diverse aspects of the neural microenvironment. Moreover, formation of certain nervous system growth patterns in vitro remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a deep hemispherical, microchannel-networked, concave array system and applied it to generate three-dimensional nerve-like neural bundles. The deep hemicylindrical channel network was easily fabricated by exploiting the meniscus induced by the surface tension of a liquid poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) prepolymer. Neurospheroids spontaneously aggregated in each deep concave microwell and were networked to neighboring spheroids through the deep hemicylindrical channel. Notably, two types of satellite spheroids also formed in deep hemispherical microchannels through self-aggregation and acted as an anchoring point to enhance formation of nerve-like networks with neighboring spheroids. During neural-network formation, neural progenitor cells successfully differentiated into glial and neuronal cells. These cells secreted laminin, forming an extracellular matrix around the host and satellite spheroids.

The middle cerebral artery (MCA) of adult rats was occluded for 2 hours and then reperfused. aLA (20 mg/kg) was administered in 71 animals (aLA group) through the left external jugular vein immediately after reperfusion. An equivalent volume of vehicle was administered to 71 animals (control group). Functional outcome, levels of endogenous neural precursors with neurogenesis, glial cell activation, and brain metabolism were evaluated. Immediate aLA administration after reperfusion resulted in significantly reduced mortality, infarct size, and neurological deficit score (NDS) in the test group compared to the control group. Long-term functional outcomes, measured by the rotarod test, were markedly improved by aLA treatment. There was a significant increase in the number of cells expressing nestin and GFAP in the boundary zone and infarct core regions after aLA treatment.

Activation triggers a cascade of further signalling events that ultimately result in cell function changes. Each of the several known G-protein types can activate multiple pathways. Interestingly, since several G-proteins can couple to the same serotonin receptor type, receptor activation can result in induction of different pathways. To reach a better understanding of the role, interactions and expression of G-proteins a literature search was performed in order to list all the known heterotrimeric combinations and serotonin receptor complexes. Public databases were analysed to collect transcript and protein expression data relating to G-proteins in neural tissues. Only a very small number of heterotrimeric combinations and G-protein-receptor complexes out of the possible thousands suggested by expression data analysis have been examined experimentally.

Understanding how to improve a system provides valuable insights into how the system works under normal conditions, because this involves understanding what the crucial components are. Therefore, more can be learned about the basic mechanisms of memory by studying mutant mice with enhanced memory. This review will summarize the genes and signaling pathways that are altered in the mutants with enhanced memory, as well as their roles in synaptic plasticity.

Chronic neuroinflammation was induced by chronic infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the fourth ventricle in Fischer-344 rats. The status of hippocampus-dependent memory was evaluated in control rats and rats chronically infused with LPS. Microglial activation in the hippocampus was examined using immunohistochemical staining.

Chronic LPS infusion reduced the levels of GluN2A and GluN2B and increased the levels of phosphorylated MAPKs in the hippocampus. MAPK-positive immunoreactivity was observed mostly in the neurons and also in non-neuronal cells.

While the roles of TRPV1 in peripheral nociception and sensitization have been well documented, less is known about its contribution to pain-related cortical plasticity. Here, we used 64 multi-electrode array recording to examine the potential role of TRPV1 in two major forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We found that pharmacological blockade of TRPV1 with either [(E)-3-(4-t-Butylphenyl)-N-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)acrylamide] (AMG9810, 10 μM) or N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamide (SB366791, 20 μM) failed to affect LTP induced by strong theta burst stimulation in the ACC of adult mice. Similarly, neither AMG9810 nor SB366791 blocked the cingulate LTD induced by low-frequency stimulation. Analysis of the results from different layers of the ACC obtained the same conclusions. Spatial distribution of LTP or LTD-showing channels among the ACC network was also unaltered by the TRPV1 antagonists. Since cortical LTP and LTD in the ACC play critical roles in chronic pain triggered by inflammation or nerve injury, our findings suggest that TRPV1 may not be a viable target for treating chronic pain, especially at the cortical level.","c(""A terior ci gulate cortex"", ""Lo g-term pote tiatio "", ""Lo g-term depressio "", ""Multi-electrode array"", ""Tra sie t receptor pote tial va illoid type 1"", ""Chro ic pai "")","Min Zhuo","min.zhuo@utoronto.a","05 April 2014"

International genetic screening programs, that together have analysed several hundred probands, have recently generated a clear picture of genotype-phenotype correlations and the prevalence of different categories of hyperekplexia mutations. Focusing largely on this new information, this review seeks to summarise the effects of mutations on glycine receptor structure and function and how these functional alterations lead to hyperekplexia.","c(""Cys-loop receptor"", ""Liga d-gated io cha el"", ""Chloride cha el"", ""Startle disease"", ""Glyci ergic eurotra smissio "")","Joseph W Lynch","j.lynh@uq.edu.au","09 January 2014"

Since round Iba-1+/CD45+ monocytes infiltrated before the repair, we examined whether these cells were involved in the repair process. Analysis of mRNA expression profiles showed significant upregulation of repair/resolution-related genes, whereas proinflammatory-related genes were barely detectable at 3 d, a time when monocytes filled injury sites. Moreover, Iba-1+/CD45+ cells highly expressed phagocytic activity markers (e.g., the mannose receptors, CD68 and LAMP2), but not proinflammatory mediators (e.g., iNOS and IL1β). In addition, the distribution of round Iba-1+/CD45+ cells was spatially and temporally correlated with astrocyte recovery.

Recent findings suggest that the central amygdala (CeA) plays an active role in the acquisition of fear learning. However, little is known about the synaptic properties of the CeA in fear learning. The capsular part of the central amygdala (CeC) receives direct nociceptive information from the external part of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPB), as well as highly processed polymodal signals from the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). Therefore, we focused on CeC as a convergence point for polymodal BLA signals and nociceptive lPB signals, and explored the synaptic regulation of these pathways in fear conditioning.","c(""Ce tral amygdala"", ""Fear co ditio i g"", ""Sy apse"", ""Plasticity"", ""Pote tiatio "", ""Mouse"", ""Nociceptio "")","Ayako M Watabe","awatabe@jikei.a.jp","01 March 2013"
"The CaMKII/NMDAR complex as a molecular memory","c(""Magdalena Sanhueza"", ""John Lisman"")","https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-10","CaMKII is a major synaptic protein that is activated during the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by the Ca2+ influx through NMDARs. This activation is required for LTP induction, but the role of the kinase in the maintenance of LTP is less clear. Elucidating the mechanisms of maintenance may provide insights into the molecular processes that underlie the stability of stored memories. In this brief review, we will outline the criteria for evaluating an LTP maintenance mechanism. The specific hypothesis evaluated is that LTP is maintained by the complex of activated CaMKII with the NMDAR. The evidence in support of this hypothesis is substantial, but further experiments are required, notably to determine the time course and persistence of complex after LTP induction. Additional work is also required to elucidate how the CaMKII/NMDAR complex produces the structural growth of the synapse that underlies late LTP. It has been proposed by Frey and Morris that late LTP involves the setting of a molecular tag during LTP induction, which subsequently allows the activated synapse to capture the proteins responsible for late LTP. However, the molecular processes by which this leads to the structural growth that underlies late LTP are completely unclear. Based on known binding reactions, we suggest the first molecularly specific version of tag/capture hypothesis: that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex, once formed, serves as a tag, which then leads to a binding cascade involving densin, delta-catenin, and N-cadherin (some of which are newly synthesized). Delta-catenin binds AMPA-binding protein (ABP), leading to the LTP-induced increase in AMPA channel content. The addition of postsynaptic N-cadherin, and the complementary increase on the presynaptic side, leads to a trans-synaptically coordinated increase in synapse size (and more release sites). It is suggested that synaptic strength is stored stably through the combined actions of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex and N-cadherin dimers. These N-cadherin pairs have redundant storage that could provide informational stability in a manner analogous to the base-pairing in DNA.","c(""Basal Tra smissio "", ""Mutatio L1298A"", ""AMPA Cha el"", ""Sy apse Size"", ""CaMKII Holoe zyme"")","John Lisman","Lisman@brandeis.edu","14 February 2013"

The morphological analyses indicated that the number of processes and spines in pyramidal neurons increased, whereas the processes of GABAergic neurons decreased in the barrel cortex. The upregulation of excitatory neurons and the downregulation of inhibitory neurons boost the activity of network neurons in the barrel cortex to be high levels, which prevent the loss of their functions and enhances their sensitivity to sensory inputs.

"Memory maintenance by PKMζ — an evolutionary perspective","Todd Charlton Sacktor","https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-5-31","Long-term memory is believed to be maintained by persistent modifications of synaptic transmission within the neural circuits that mediate behavior. Thus, long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely studied as a potential physiological basis for the persistent enhancement of synaptic strength that might sustain memory. Whereas the molecular mechanisms that initially induce LTP have been extensively characterized, the mechanisms that persistently maintain the potentiation have not. Recently, however, a candidate molecular mechanism linking the maintenance of LTP and the storage of long-term memory has been identified. The persistent activity of the autonomously active, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoform, PKMζ, is both necessary and sufficient for maintaining LTP. Furthermore, blocking PKMζ activity by pharmacological or dominant negative inhibitors disrupts previously stored long-term memories in a variety of neural circuits, including spatial and trace memories in the hippocampus, aversive memories in the basolateral amygdala, appetitive memories in the nucleus accumbens, habit memory in the dorsal lateral striatum, and elementary associations, extinction, and skilled sensorimotor memories in the neocortex. During LTP and memory formation, PKMζ is synthesized de novo as a constitutively active kinase. This molecular mechanism for memory storage is evolutionarily conserved. PKMζ formation through new protein synthesis likely originated in early vertebrates ~500 million years ago during the Cambrian period. Other mechanisms for forming persistently active PKM from aPKC are found in invertebrates, and inhibiting this atypical PKM disrupts long-term memory in the invertebrate model systems Drosophila melanogaster and Aplysia californica. Conversely, overexpressing PKMζ enhances memory in flies and rodents. PKMζ persistently enhances synaptic strength by maintaining increased numbers of AMPA receptors at postsynaptic sites, a mechanism that might have evolved from the general function of aPKC in trafficking membrane proteins to the apical compartment of polarized cells.

Probing the mechanisms of such impairment may provide much needed means of diagnosis and therapeutic intervention at an early, pre-dementia, stage. Prior to the onset of significant neurodegeneration, the structural and functional integrity of synapses in mnemonic circuitry is severely compromised in the presence of amyloidosis. This review examines recent evidence evaluating the role of amyloid-ß protein (Aβ) in causing rapid disruption of synaptic plasticity and memory impairment. We evaluate the relative importance of different sizes and conformations of Aβ, including monomer, oligomer, protofibril and fibril. We pay particular attention to recent controversies over the relevance to the pathophysiology of AD of different water soluble Aβ aggregates and the importance of cellular prion protein in mediating their effects. Current data are consistent with the view that both low-n oligomers and larger soluble assemblies present in AD brain, some of them via a direct interaction with cellular prion protein, cause synaptic memory failure. At the two extremes of aggregation, monomers and fibrils appear to act in vivo both as sources and sinks of certain metastable conformations of soluble aggregates that powerfully disrupt synaptic plasticity.

The rat model of CIP consisted of unilateral intra-tibial injection with Walker 256 mammary gland carcinoma. Nine days after Walker 256 inoculation, a robust activation of both astrocytes and microglia in bilateral spinal dorsal horn was observed together with significant bilateral mechanical allodynia. This neuroinflammation was characterized by enhanced immunostaining of both glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, astrocyte marker) and OX-42 (microglia marker), and an elevated level of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA.

Trace fear learning engages the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but whether plastic events occur within the ACC in response to trace fear learning, and whether GluN2B subunits are required remains unknown. Here we show that the ACC is necessary for trace fear learning, and shows a rapid 20% upregulation of membrane AMPA receptor GluA1 subunits that is evident immediately after conditioning. Inhibition of NMDA receptor GluN2B subunits during training prevented the upregulation, and disrupted trace fear memory retrieval 48 h later. Furthermore, intra-ACC injections of the CP-AMPAR channel antagonist, 1-naphthylacetyl spermine (NASPM) immediately following trace fear conditioning blocked 24 h fear memory retrieval.

Galectin-1(Gal1) is a lectin that is expressed in damaged brain areas after ischemia. Here, we characterized the detailed Gal1 expression pattern in an animal model of brain ischemia. After brain ischemia, Gal1 was expressed in reactive astrocytes within and around the infarcted region, and its expression diminished over time. Previously, we showed that infusion of human Gal1 protein (hGal1) resulted in functional recovery after brain ischemia but failed to reduce the volume of the ischemic region. This prompted us to examine whether the combination of hNSPCs-transplantation and stable delivery of hGal1 around the ischemic region could reduce the ischemic volume and promote better functional recovery after brain ischemia. In this study, we transplanted hNSPCs that stably overexpressed hGal1 (hGal1-hNSPCs) in a model of unilateral focal brain ischemia using Mongolian gerbils. Indeed, we found that transplantation of hGal1-hNSPCs both reduced the ischemic volume and improved deficits in motor function after brain ischemia to a greater extent than the transplantation of hNSPCs alone.

PAR1 activation enhances excitatory synaptic transmission secondary to the release of glutamate from astrocytes following activation of astrocytically-expressed PAR1. In addition, PAR1 activation exacerbates neuronal damage in multiple in vivo models of brain injury in a manner that is dependent on NMDA receptors. In the hippocampal formation, PAR1 mRNA appears to be expressed by a subset of neurons, including granule cells in the dentate gyrus. In this study we investigate the role of PAR activation in controlling neuronal excitability of dentate granule cells. We confirm that PAR1 protein is expressed in neurons of the dentate cell body layer as well as in astrocytes throughout the dentate. Activation of PAR1 receptors by the selective peptide agonist TFLLR increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a subset of acutely dissociated dentate neurons as well as non-neuronal cells. Bath application of TFLLR in acute hippocampal slices depolarized the dentate gyrus, including the hilar region in wild type but not in the PAR1-/- mice. PAR1 activation increased the frequency of action potential generation in a subset of dentate granule neurons; cells in which PAR1 activation triggered action potentials showed a significant depolarization. The activation of PAR1 by thrombin increased the amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated component of EPSPs.

How this occurs, however, is still only partially understood. To investigate the trafficking of AMPA receptors in real-time we previously tagged the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors with ecliptic pHluorin and studied the effects of NMDA receptor activation. In the present study we have compared the effect of NMDA receptor and group I mGluR activation, using GluA2 tagged with super ecliptic pHluorin (SEP-GluA2) expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Surprisingly, agonists of the two receptors, which are both able to induce chemical forms of LTD, had clearly distinct effects on AMPA receptor trafficking. In agreement with our previous work we found that transient NMDA receptor activation results in an initial decrease in surface GluA2 from extrasynaptic sites followed by a delayed reduction in GluA2 from puncta (putative synapses). In contrast, transient activation of group I mGluRs, using DHPG, led to a pronounced but more delayed decrease in GluA2 from the dendritic shafts. Surprisingly, there was no average change in the fluorescence of the puncta. Examination of fluorescence at individual puncta, however, indicated that alterations did take place, with some puncta showing an increase and others a decrease in fluorescence. The effects of DHPG were, like DHPG-induced LTD, prevented by treatment with a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor. The electrophysiological correlate of the effects of DHPG in the SEP-GluA2 infected cultures was a reduction in mEPSC frequency with no change in amplitude. The implications of these findings for the initial mechanisms of expression of both NMDA receptor- and mGluR-induced LTD are discussed.","c(""Sy aptic plasticity"", ""lo g-term depressio "", ""DHPG"", ""GluA2"", ""NMDA"", ""mGluR"", ""super ecliptic phluori "")","Stephen M Fitzjohn","fitzjohnst@lilly.om","27 July 2011"

Much previous work has focused on the deleterious effects of METH on mature neurons, but little is known about the effects of METH on neural progenitor cells (NPCs). It is now well established that new neurons are continuously generated from NPCs in the adult hippocampus, and accumulating evidence suggests important roles for these neurons in hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions. In a rat hippocampal NPC culture system, we find that METH results in a dose-dependent reduction of NPC proliferation, and higher concentrations of METH impair NPC survival. NPC differentiation, however, is not affected by METH, suggesting cell-stage specificity of the effects of METH. We demonstrate that the effects of METH on NPCs are, in part, mediated through oxidative and nitrosative stress. Further, we identify seventeen NPC proteins that are post-translationally modified via 3-nitrotyrosination in response to METH, using mass spectrometric approaches. One such protein was pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), an important mediator of cellular energetics and proliferation. We identify sites of PKM2 that undergo nitrotyrosination, and demonstrate that nitration of the protein impairs its activity. Thus, METH abuse may result in impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and effects on NPCs may be mediated by protein nitration. Our study has implications for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for METH-abusing individuals with neurologic dysfunction and may be applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases in which hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired.","c(""Pyruvate Ki ase"", ""Hippocampal Neuroge esis"", ""Nitrosative Stress"", ""Tyrosi e Nitratio "", ""Adult Hippocampal Neuroge esis"")","Arun Venkatesan","avenkat2@jhmi.edu","27 June 2011"

Deposition of Aβ plaques is also a common pathological feature of HIV infection. However, it is not clear whether this accumulation is due to AD-like processes, HIV-associated immunosuppression, Tat protein-induced Aβ elevations, and/or the effects of single highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here we evaluated the effects of several ART medications (Zidovudine, Lamivudine, Indinavir, and Abacavir) alone and in combination on: 1) Aβ1-40, 42 generation in murine N2a cells transfected with the human ""Swedish"" mutant form of APP; 2) microglial phagocytosis of FITC-Aβ1-42 peptides in cultured murine N9 microglia. We report for the first time that these antiretroviral compounds (10 μM) generally increase Aβ generation (~50-200%) in SweAPP N2a cells and markedly inhibit microglial phagocytosis of FITC-Aβ1-42 peptides in murine microglia. The most significant amyloidogenic effects were observed with combined ART (p < 0.05); suggesting certain ART medications may have additive amyloidogenic effects when combined. As these antiretroviral compounds are capable of penetrating the blood brain barrier and reaching the concentrations employed in the in vitro studies, these findings raise the possibility that ART may play a casual role in the elevated Aβ found in the brains of those infected with HIV.

The Staufen 1 (Stau1) isoform was recently identified as necessary for the protein synthesis-dependent late phase long-term potentiation (late-LTP) and for the maintenance of mature dendritic spines and synaptic activity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, strongly suggesting a role of mRNA regulation by Stau1 in these processes. However, the causal relationship between these impairments in synaptic function (spine shape and basal synaptic activity) and plasticity (late-LTP) remains unclear. Here, we determine that the effects of Stau1 knockdown on spine shape and size are mimicked by blocking NMDA receptors (or elevating extracellular Mg2+) and that Stau1 knockdown in the presence of NMDA receptor blockade (or high Mg2+) has no further effect on spine shape and size. Moreover, the effect of Stau1 knockdown on late-LTP cannot be explained by these effects, since when tested in normal medium, slice cultures that had been treated with high Mg2+ (to impair NMDA receptor function) in combination with a control siRNA still exhibited late-LTP, while siRNA to Stau1 was still effective in blocking late-LTP. Our results indicate that Stau1 involvement in spine morphogenesis is dependent on ongoing NMDA receptor-mediated plasticity, but its effects on late-LTP are independent of these changes. These findings clarify the role of Stau1-dependent mRNA regulation in physiological and morphological changes underlying long-term synaptic plasticity in pyramidal cells.","c(""Schaffer collateral sy apses"", ""RNA tra sport"", ""late LTP"", ""spo ta eous activity-drive pote tiatio "", ""spi e morphoge esis"")","Jean-Claude Lacaille","jean-laude.laaille@umontreal.a","02 June 2011"

Extensive characterization of the transcriptional regulation of the 5-HT1A gene (HTR1A) using cell culture systems has revealed a GC-rich ""housekeeping"" promoter that non-selectively drives its expression; this is flanked by a series of upstream repressor elements for REST, Freud-1/CC2D1A and Freud-2/CC2D1B factors that not only restrict its expression to neurons, but may also regulate the level of expression of 5-HT1A receptors in various subsets of neurons, including serotonergic neurons.

In the present study, we describe a genetic and functional interaction between the innexin UNC-7 and the cation leak channel NCA in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons. While the loss of the neuronal NCA channel function leads to a reduced evoked postsynaptic current at neuromuscular junctions, a simultaneous loss of the UNC-7 function restores the evoked response. The expression of UNC-7 in neurons reverts the effect of the unc-7 mutation; moreover, the expression of UNC-7 mutant proteins that are predicted to be unable to form gap junctions also reverts this effect, suggesting that UNC-7 innexin regulates neuronal activity, in part, through gap junction-independent functions.

However, it remains unclear whether there is a cell fate switch of Math5-lineage cells in the absence of Math5 and whether MATH5 cell-autonomously regulates the differentiation of the above retinal neurons. Here, we performed a lineage analysis of Math5-expressing cells in developing mouse retinas using a conditional GFP reporter (Z/EG) activated by a Math5-Cre knock-in allele. We show that during normal retinogenesis, Math5-lineage cells mostly develop into RGCs, horizontal cells, cone photoreceptors, rod photoreceptors, and amacrine cells. Interestingly, amacrine cells of Math5-lineage cells are predominately of GABAergic, cholinergic, and A2 subtypes, indicating that Math5 plays a role in amacrine subtype specification. In the absence of Math5, more Math5-lineage cells undergo cell fate conversion from RGCs to the above retinal cell subtypes, and occasionally to cone-bipolar cells and Müller cells. This change in cell fate choices is accompanied by an up-regulation of NEUROD1, RXRγ and BHLHB5, the transcription factors essential for the differentiation of retinal cells other than RGCs. Additionally, loss of Math5 causes the failure of early progenitors to exit cell cycle and leads to a significant increase of Math5-lineage cells remaining in cell cycle.

In the hippocampus, this approach has been frequently applied to the investigation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the perforant and Schaffer collateral commissural pathways, the first and third components of the classical hippocampal trisynaptic circuit, respectively.

This process is important for establishing normal brain function and is dependent on cholinergic modulation via muscarinic receptors. Five muscarinic receptor genes encode five unique receptor subtypes (M1-5). The distributions and functions of each subtype vary in central and peripheral systems. In the brain, the M1 receptor is most abundant in the cerebral cortex, where its immunoreactivity peaks transiently during early development. This likely signifies the importance of M1 receptor in the development and maintenance of normal cortical function. Several lines of study have outlined the roles of M1 receptors in the development and plasticity of the auditory cortex. For example, M1-knockout reduces experience-dependent plasticity and disrupts tonotopic mapping in the adult mouse auditory cortex. Further evidence demonstrates a role for M1 in neurite outgrowth and hence determining the structure of cortical neurons. The disruption of tonotopic maps in M1-knockout mice may be linked to alterations in thalamocortical connectivity, because the targets of thalamocortical afferents (layer IV cortical neurons) appear less mature in M1 knockouts.

Our previous study showed that long-term potentiation (LTP) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was significantly enhanced in transgenic mice overexpressing CaMKIV. Considering that the CaMKIV-CREB pathway plays a central role in the protein synthesis-dependent LTP, it is possible that upregulation of CaMKIV contributes to enhancement of LTP by promoting protein synthesis. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of transcription and translation inhibitors on synaptic potentiation induced by pairing of synaptic activity with postsynaptic depolarization (paired training) in ACC pyramidal neurons of wild-type and CaMKIV transgenic mice. We found that synaptic potentiation induced by paired training was partially inhibited by transcription or translation inhibitors both in wild-type and CaMKIV transgenic mice; the extent of inhibition was markedly larger in the CaMKIV transgenic mice than in the wild-type mice. Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies revealed that CaMKIV was distributed in the membrane, cytosol and nucleus of ACC neurons.

Four to seven Hertz (4-7 Hz) oscillations in the prefrontal cortex are also postulated to be involved in learning and attention processes. Additionally, slow delta oscillations (1-4 Hz) have been proposed to be involved in memory consolidation or even synaptic down scaling during sleep. The molecular mechanisms which link learning-related oscillations during wakefulness to sleep-related oscillations remain unknown. We show that increasing the expression of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), a key nucleic protein kinase, selectively enhances 4-7.5 Hz oscillation power during trace fear learning and slow delta oscillations during subsequent sleep. These oscillations were found to be boosted in response to the trace fear paradigm and are likely to be localized to regions of the prefrontal cortex. Correlation analyses demonstrate that a proportion of the variance in 4-7.5 Hz oscillations, during fear conditioning, could account for some degree of learning and subsequent memory formation, while changes in slow delta power did not share this predictive strength. Our data emphasize the role of CaMKIV in controlling learning and sleep-related oscillations and suggest that oscillatory activity during wakefulness may be a relevant predictor of subsequent memory consolidation.","c(""Wild Type Mouse"", ""Motor Cortex"", ""A terior Ci gulate Cortex"", ""Memory Co solidatio "", ""NREM Sleep"")","Min Zhuo","min.zhuo@utoronto.a","24 May 2010"

Like other prion disorders such a sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob-disease of humans and Mad Cow Disease of cattle, CWD is caused by PrP-scrapie (PrPSc), a β-sheet rich isoform of a normal cell surface glycoprotein, the prion protein (PrPC). Since PrPSc is sufficient to cause infection and neurotoxicity if ingested by a susceptible host, it is important to understand the mechanism by which it crosses the stringent epithelial cell barrier of the small intestine. Possible mechanisms include co-transport with ferritin in ingested food and uptake by dendritic cells. Since ferritin is ubiquitously expressed and shares considerable homology among species, co-transport of PrPSc with ferritin can result in cross-species spread with deleterious consequences. We have used a combination of in vitro and in vivo models of intestinal epithelial cell barrier to understand the role of ferritin in mediating PrPSc uptake and transport. In this report, we demonstrate that PrPSc and ferritin from CWD affected deer and elk brains and scrapie from sheep resist degradation by digestive enzymes, and are transcytosed across a tight monolayer of human epithelial cells with significant efficiency. Likewise, ferritin from hamster brains is taken up by mouse intestinal epithelial cells in vivo, indicating that uptake of ferritin is not limited by species differences as described for prions. More importantly, the iron content of ferritin determines its efficiency of uptake and transport by Caco-2 cells and mouse models, providing insight into the mechanism(s) of ferritin and PrPSc uptake by intestinal epithelial cells.","c(""Ferriti "", ""Brai Homoge ate"", ""Scrapie"", ""Chro ic Wasti g Disease"", ""Scrapie I fected Mouse"")","Neena Singh","neena.singh@ase.edu","29 April 2010"

In order to be able to easily identify the stages of differentiation of neural cells, we have been attempting to establish a mouse system that would allow progression of neuronal differentiation to be visualized based on transitions between fluorescence colors by using a combination of mouse genetics and the ever-expanding repertoire of fluorescent proteins. In this study we report the initial version of such a mouse system, which we call ""Color Timer.""

We then confirmed by immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical analyses that the KOr fluorescence closely reflected the presence of the Nestin protein. We also confirmed by a neurosphere formation assay that the intensity of the KOr fluorescence correlated with ""stemness"" of the cell and it was possible to readily identify NSCs in the two neurogenic regions, namely the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle, in the brain of adult nestin/KOr Tg mice by the orange fluorescence they emitted. We then crossed nestin/KOr mice with doublecortin-enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein Tg mice, whose immature neurons emit green fluorescence upon excitation, and it was possible to visualize the progress of NSC-to-neuron differentiation by the transition between fluorescence colors from orange to green.

This results in the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and the activation of protein kinase C. The activation of Group I mGluRs also results in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We show here, that the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) interacts with both mGluR1 and mGluR5 and is precipitated with both receptors from rat brain. Pyk2 also interacts with GST-fusion proteins corresponding to the second intracellular loop and the distal carboxyl-terminal tail domains of mGluR1a. Pyk2 colocalizes with mGluR1a at the plasma membrane in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and with endogenous mGluR5 in cortical neurons. Pyk2 overexpression in HEK293 results in attenuated basal and agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in mGluR1 expressing cells and involves a mechanism whereby Pyk2 displaces Gαq/11 from the receptor. The activation of endogenous mGluR1 in primary mouse cortical neuron stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Treatments that prevent Pyk2 phosphorylation in cortical neurons, and the overexpression of Pyk2 dominant-negative and catalytically inactive Pyk2 mutants in HEK293 cells, prevent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The Pyk2 mediated activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is also Src-, calmodulin- and protein kinase C-dependent.

In the present study, we characterized the neuronal connections in the superficial layers (I-III) of the mouse ACC using dual whole-cell patch clamp recording technique. Four types of synaptic connections were observed, which are from a pyramidal neuron to a pyramidal neuron, from a pyramidal neuron to an interneuron, from an interneuron to a pyramidal neuron and from an interneuron to an interneuron. These connections exist among neurons in layer II/III or between neurons located layer I and II/III, respectively. Moreover, reciprocal connections exist in all four types of paired neurons. Our results provide the first key evidence of functional excitatory and inhibitory connections in the ACC.","c(""A terior Ci gulate Cortex"", ""Pyramidal Neuro "", ""Sy aptic Co ectio "", ""Postsy aptic Neuro "", ""I hibitory Co ectio "")","Min Zhuo","min.zhuo@utoronto.a","15 October 2009"

How synaptic cargos achieve specificity, directionality and timing of transport is a developing area of investigation. Recent studies demonstrate that the docking of motors to their cargos is a key control point. Moreover, precise spatial and temporal regulation of motor-cargo interactions is important for transport specificity and cargo recruitment.

Degeneration of Purkinje cells is a common feature of inherited ataxias in humans and mice. To understand Purkinje neuron degeneration, investigators have turned to naturally occurring Purkinje cell degeneration phenotypes in mice to identify key regulatory proteins and cellular pathways. The Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mouse is a recessive mutant characterized by complete and dramatic post-natal, cell autonomous Purkinje neuron degeneration and death. As the basis of Purkinje cell death in pcd is unresolved, and contradictory data has emerged for the role of autophagy in Purkinje cell degeneration, we studied the mechanism of Purkinje cell death in pcd mice. BAX null status did not suppress Purkinje neuron death in pcd mice, indicating that classic apoptosis is not responsible for Purkinje cell loss. Interestingly, LC3 Western blot analysis and GFP-LC3 immunostaining of degenerating pcd cerebellum revealed activation of the autophagy pathway. Ultrastructural studies confirmed increased autophagy pathway activity in Purkinje cells, and yielded evidence for mitophagy, in agreement with LC3 immunoblotting of cerebellar fractions. As p62 levels were decreased in pcd cerebellum, our findings suggest that pcd Purkinje cell neurons can execute effective autophagy. However, our results support a role for dysregulated autophagy activation in pcd, and suggest that increased or aberrant mitophagy contributes to the Purkinje cell degeneration in pcd mice.","c(""Purki je Cell"", ""Purki je Neuro "", ""Autophagy Pathway"", ""Autophagy Activatio "", ""Homozygous Mouse"")","Albert R La Spada","laspada@u.washington.edu","29 July 2009"

To directly examine the Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking in ALS2-/- neurons, we introduced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rab5 into cultured hippocampal neurons to monitor the morphology and motility of Rab5-associated early endosomes. Here we report that Rab5-mediated endocytosis was severely altered in ALS2-/-neurons. Excessive accumulation of Rab5-positive vesicles was observed in ALS2-/- neurons, which correlated with a significant reduction in endosomal motility and augmentation in endosomal conversion to lysosomes. Consequently, a significant increase in endosome/lysosome-dependent degradation of internalized glutamate receptors was observed in ALS2-/- neurons. These phenotypes closely resembled the endosomal trafficking abnormalities induced by a constitutively active form of Rab5 in wild-type neurons. Therefore, our findings reveal a negatively regulatory mechanism of alsin in Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking, suggesting that enhanced endosomal degradation in ALS2-/- neurons may underlie the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration in ALS2 and related motor neuron diseases.","c(""Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"", ""Early E dosome"", ""Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia"", ""Motor Neuro Dege eratio "", ""ALS2 Ge e"")","c(""Chen Lai"", ""Huaibin Cai"")","""laihi@mail.nih.gov"", ""aih@mail.nih.gov""","24 July 2009"

The hippocampal neurons are vulnerable to epilepsy-induced pathologic changes and often manifests as neuronal death. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of maternal epileptic seizure on apoptotic neuronal death, modulation of GABAB1 receptor (R), and protein kinase A-α (PKA) in prenatal rat hippocampal neurons at gestational days (GD) 17.5. Seizure was induced in pregnant rat using intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (40 mg/kg for 15 days). To confirm the seizure electroencephalography (EEG) data was obtained by the Laxtha EEG-monitoring device in the EEG recording room and EEG were monitored 5 min and 15 min after PTZ injection. The RT-PCR and Western blot results showed significant increased expression of cytochrome-c and caspases-3, while decreased levels of GABAB1R, and PKA protein expression upon ethanol, PTZ and ethanol plus PTZ exposure in primary neuronal cells cultured from PTZ-induced seizure model as compare to non-PTZ treated maternal group. Apoptotic neurodegeneration was further confirmed with Fluoro-Jade B and propidium iodide staining, where neurons were scattered and shrunken, with markedly condensed nuclei in PTZ treated group compared with control. This study for the first time indicate that PTZ-induced seizures triggered activation of caspases-3 to induce widespread apoptotic neuronal death and decreased GABAB1R expression in hippocampal neurons, providing a possible mechanistic link between maternal epilepsy induced neurodegeneration alteration of GABAB1R and PKA expression level during prenatal brain development. This revealed new aspects of PTZ and ethanol's modulation on GABAB1R, learning and memory. Further, explain the possibility that children delivered by epileptic mothers may have higher risk of developmental disturbances and malformations.","c(""Hippocampal Neuro "", ""Baclofe "", ""Hippocampal Neuro al Cell"", ""Apoptotic Neuro al Death"", ""Apoptotic Neurodege eratio "")","Myeong Ok Kim","mokim@gsnu.a.kr","22 June 2009"

The mechanism by which cocaine causes neurological damage is very complex and involves several neurotransmitter systems. For example, cocaine increases extracellular levels of dopamine and free radicals, and modulates several transcription factors. NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression involved in cellular death. Our aim was to investigate the toxicity and modulation of NF-κB activity by cocaine in PC 12 cells. Treatment with cocaine (1 mM) for 24 hours induced DNA fragmentation, cellular membrane rupture and reduction of mitochondrial activity. A decrease in Bcl-2 protein and mRNA levels, and an increase in caspase 3 activity and cleavage were also observed. In addition, cocaine (after 6 hours treatment) activated the p50/p65 subunit of NF-κB complex and the pretreatment of the cells with SCH 23390, a D1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the NF-κB activation. Inhibition of NF-κB activity by using PDTC and Sodium Salicilate increased cell death caused by cocaine. These results suggest that cocaine induces cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) and activates NF-κB in PC12 cells.

Mossy fiber paths and synapses are primarily restricted to the stratum lucidum within the CA3 region. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin family protein that activates Trk neurotrophin receptors, is highly expressed in the stratum lucidum in an activity-dependent manner. The addition of a Trk neurotrophin receptor inhibitor, K252a, to cultured hippocampal slices induced aberrant extension of mossy fibers into ectopic regions. BDNF overexpression in granule cells ameliorated the mossy fiber pathway abnormalities caused by a submaximal dose of K252a. A similar rescue was observed when BDNF was expressed in CA3 pyramidal cells, most notably in mossy fibers distal to the expression site. These findings are the first to clarify the role of BDNF in mossy fiber pathfinding, not as an attractant cue but as a regulator, possibly acting in a paracrine manner. This effect of BDNF may be as a signal for new fibers to fasciculate and extend further to form synapses with neurons that are far from active BDNF-expressing synapses.

This interaction permits the daily rhythm of sleep and wake, regulated in parallel by circadian cues originating from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and arousal-promoting signals arising from the orexin-containing neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus (TH). Intriguingly, the SCN circadian clock can be reset by arousal-promoting stimuli while activation of orexin/hypocretin neurons is believed to be under circadian control, suggesting the existence of a reciprocal relationship. Unfortunately, since orexin neurons are themselves activated by locomotor promoting cues, it is unclear how these two systems interact to regulate behavioral rhythms. Here mice were placed in conditions of constant light, which suppressed locomotor activity, but also revealed a highly pronounced circadian pattern in orexin neuronal activation. Significantly, activation of orexin neurons in the medial and lateral TH occurred prior to the onset of sustained wheel-running activity. Moreover, exposure to a 6 h dark pulse during the subjective day, a stimulus that promotes arousal and phase advances behavioral rhythms, activated neurons in the medial and lateral TH including those containing orexin. Concurrently, this stimulus suppressed SCN activity while activating cells in the median raphe. In contrast, dark pulse exposure during the subjective night did not reset SCN-controlled behavioral rhythms and caused a transient suppression of neuronal activation in the TH. Collectively these results demonstrate, for the first time, pronounced circadian control of orexin neuron activation and implicate recruitment of orexin cells in dark pulse resetting of the SCN circadian clock.","c(""Syria Hamster"", ""Circadia Time"", ""Circadia Cycle"", ""Orexi Neuro "", ""Subjective Night"")","Hugh D Piggins","hugh.piggins@manhester.a.uk","03 December 2008"

To investigate mechanisms for α-syn accumulation and toxicity, we studied a mouse model of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D (CD) deficiency, and found extensive accumulation of endogenous α-syn in neurons without overabundance of α-syn mRNA. In addition to impaired macroautophagy, CD deficiency reduced proteasome activity, suggesting an essential role for lysosomal CD function in regulating multiple proteolytic pathways that are important for α-syn metabolism. Conversely, CD overexpression reduces α-syn aggregation and is neuroprotective against α-syn overexpression-induced cell death in vitro. In a C. elegans model, CD deficiency exacerbates α-syn accumulation while its overexpression is protective against α-syn-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Mutated CD with diminished enzymatic activity or overexpression of cathepsins B (CB) or L (CL) is not protective in the worm model, indicating a unique requirement for enzymatically active CD.

The identification and investigation of clinical endophenotypes may be one solution, but represents a considerable challenge in human subjects. Here we report that mice heterozygous for a null mutation of the alpha-isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (alpha-CaMKII+/-) have profoundly dysregulated behaviours and impaired neuronal development in the dentate gyrus (DG). The behavioral abnormalities include a severe working memory deficit and an exaggerated infradian rhythm, which are similar to symptoms seen in schizophrenia, bipolar mood disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Transcriptome analysis of the hippocampus of these mutants revealed that the expression levels of more than 2000 genes were significantly changed. Strikingly, among the 20 most downregulated genes, 5 had highly selective expression in the DG. Whereas BrdU incorporated cells in the mutant mouse DG was increased by more than 50 percent, the number of mature neurons in the DG was dramatically decreased. Morphological and physiological features of the DG neurons in the mutants were strikingly similar to those of immature DG neurons in normal rodents. Moreover, c-Fos expression in the DG after electric footshock was almost completely and selectively abolished in the mutants. Statistical clustering of human post-mortem brains using 10 genes differentially-expressed in the mutant mice were used to classify individuals into two clusters, one of which contained 16 of 18 schizophrenic patients. Nearly half of the differentially-expressed probes in the schizophrenia-enriched cluster encoded genes that are involved in neurogenesis or in neuronal migration/maturation, including calbindin, a marker for mature DG neurons. Based on these results, we propose that an ""immature DG"" in adulthood might induce alterations in behavior and serve as a promising candidate endophenotype of schizophrenia and other human psychiatric disorders.","c(""Schizophre ia"", ""Muta t Mouse"", ""De tate Gyrus"", ""Gra ule Cell Layer"", ""Startle Stimulus"")","Tsuyoshi Miyakawa","miyakawa@fujita-hu.a.jp","10 September 2008"

"Transcriptional regulation of long-term memory in the marine snail Aplysia","c(""Yong-Seok Lee"", ""Craig H Bailey"", ""Eric R Kandel"", ""Bong-Kiun Kaang"")","https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-3","Whereas the induction of short-term memory involves only covalent modifications of constitutively expressed preexisting proteins, the formation of long-term memory requires gene expression, new RNA, and new protein synthesis. On the cellular level, transcriptional regulation is thought to be the starting point for a series of molecular steps necessary for both the initiation and maintenance of long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF). The core molecular features of transcriptional regulation involved in the long-term process are evolutionally conserved in Aplysia, Drosophila, and mouse, and indicate that gene regulation by the c yclic AMP r esponse e lement b inding protein (CREB) acting in conjunction with different combinations of transcriptional factors is critical for the expression of many forms of long-term memory. In the marine snail Aplysia, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the storage of long-term memory have been extensively studied in the monosynaptic connections between identified sensory neuron and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. One tail shock or one pulse of serotonin (5-HT), a modulatory transmitter released by tail shocks, produces a transient facilitation mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase leading to covalent modifications in the sensory neurons that results in an enhancement of transmitter release and a strengthening of synaptic connections lasting minutes. By contrast, repeated pulses of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induce a transcription- and translation-dependent long-term facilitation (LTF) lasting more than 24 h and trigger the activation of a family of transcription factors in the presynaptic sensory neurons including ApCREB1, ApCREB2 and ApC/EBP. In addition, we have recently identified novel transcription factors that modulate the expression of ApC/EBP and also are critically involved in LTF. In this review, we examine the roles of these transcription factors during consolidation of LTF induced by different stimulation paradigms.","c(""Se sory Neuro "", ""Retrograde Sig al"", ""Sy aptic Facilitatio "", ""Critical Time Wi dow"", ""Tail Shock"")","Bong-Kiun Kaang","kaang@snu.a.kr","17 June 2008"
"Cingulate NMDA NR2B receptors contribute to morphine-induced analgesic tolerance","c(""Shanelle W Ko"", ""Long-Jun Wu"", ""Fanny Shum"", ""Jessica Quan"", ""Min Zhuo"")","https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-1-2","Morphine is widely used to treat chronic pain, however its utility is hindered by the development of tolerance to its analgesic effects. While N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are known to play roles in morphine tolerance and dependence, less is known about the roles of individual NMDA receptor subtypes. In this study, Ro 256981, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B, was used to reduce the expression of analgesic tolerance to morphine. The mechanisms altered with chronic drug use share similarities with those underlying the establishment of long-tem potentiation (LTP) and behavioral memory. Since NMDA NR2B receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) play roles in the establishment of LTP and fear memory, we explored their role in changes that occur in this region after chronic morphine. Both systemic and intra-ACC inhibition of NR2B in morphine-tolerant animals inhibited the expression of analgesic tolerance. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a significant increase in the NR2B component of NMDA receptor mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), at both synaptic and extra-synaptic sites. However, there was no change in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor mediated EPSCs. This study suggests that selective inhibition of NMDA NR2B receptors may prove useful in combating the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine and proposes a novel role for the ACC in opioid tolerance and morphine induced changes in synaptic plasticity.","c(""Morphi e"", ""NMDA Receptor"", ""A terior Ci gulate Cortex"", ""NR2B Subu it"", ""Morphi e Tolera ce"")","Min Zhuo","min.zhuo@utoronto.a","17 June 2008"
