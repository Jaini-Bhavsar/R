# R
Some of the very useful projects created using the R language.

## 1. Web Scraping Using R

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to develop a specialized R program to extract and analyze article data from a selected journal. This hands-on experience aimed to enhance web scraping skills and prepare for real-world data extraction and analysis tasks. The project involved scraping specific article details, cleaning and preprocessing the data, performing basic data analysis, and creating visualizations to derive insights.

## Tools and Techniques:
* Tools: R, RStudio
* Packages Used: rvest, httr, xml2, dplyr, ggplot2
* Techniques:
Web scraping - Extracting structured data from web pages. <br />
Data cleaning - Removing irrelevant information, handling missing values, and formatting data. <br />
Data analysis - Basic exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends.<br />
Data visualization - Creating simple charts to illustrate key findings.

## Results and Insights:
* Successfully extracted detailed article data from the selected journal, demonstrating effective web scraping techniques using R.
* Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and completeness for analysis.
* Conducted data analysis, revealing key trends such as the most frequently appearing keywords in the articles.
* Developed visualizations that effectively communicated the analysis results, highlighting important insights for stakeholders.
* The project provided practical experience in handling real-world data extraction and analysis tasks, reinforcing data handling and visualization skills.

## Business Relevance:
* Automated Data Extraction: Demonstrated the ability to automate the extraction of structured data from websites, which can significantly reduce manual data collection efforts and improve efficiency.
* Data-Driven Insights: Provided actionable insights from journal article data, which can aid in research trend analysis and strategic decision-making for organizations involved in academic publishing or related fields.

## 2. Tabular Playground Series

- This project is a part of a Kaggle Competition. I have participated in the April edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground Series. 
- They have provided with thousands of sixty-second sequences of biological sensor data recorded from several hundred participants who could have been in either of two possible activity states. 
- Our task is to determine what state a participant was in from the sensor data?
