# R
Some of the very useful projects created using the R language.

**1. Web Scraping Using R**

- In this project, I have build a specialized R program to crawl, parse and extract useful information from online websites. Here, I have taken Science Journal for this project. 
- Given an input year, objective is to extract all articles published in/after that year from selected journal. Extracted the following 7 fields for each article: Title,  Authors,  Correspondence  Author, Publish Date, Abstract, Keywords, Full Paper (Text format).

**2. Tabular Playground Series**

- This project is a part of a Kaggle Competition. I have participated in the April edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground Series. 
- They have provided with thousands of sixty-second sequences of biological sensor data recorded from several hundred participants who could have been in either of two possible activity states. 
- Our task is to determine what state a participant was in from the sensor data?
