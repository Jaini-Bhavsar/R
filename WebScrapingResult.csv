                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0197-9,BenchmarkTransposable elementsPolymorphismTransposon insertionResequencing,"Transposable elements (TEs) are an important source of genomic variability in eukaryotic genomes. Their activity impacts genome architecture and gene expression and can lead to drastic phenotypic changes. Therefore, identifying TE polymorphisms is key to better understand the link between genotype and phenotype. However, most genotype-to-phenotype analyses have concentrated on single nucleotide polymorphisms as they are easier to reliable detect using short-read data. Many bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify transposon insertions from resequencing data using short reads. Nevertheless, the performance of most of these tools has been tested using simulated insertions, which do not accurately reproduce the complexity of natural insertions.,We have overcome this limitation by building a dataset of insertions from the comparison of two high-quality rice genomes, followed by extensive manual curation. This dataset contains validated insertions of two very different types of TEs, LTR-retrotransposons and MITEs. Using this dataset, we have benchmarked the sensitivity and precision of 12 commonly used tools, and our results suggest that in general their sensitivity was previously overestimated when using simulated data. Our results also show that, increasing coverage leads to a better sensitivity but with a cost in precision. Moreover, we found important differences in tool performance, with some tools performing better on a specific type of TEs. We have also used two sets of experimentally validated insertions in Drosophila and humans and show that this trend is maintained in genomes of different size and complexity.,We discuss the possible choice of tools depending on the goals of the study and show that the appropriate combination of tools could be an option for most approaches, increasing the sensitivity while maintaining a good precision.,Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a very important fraction of eukaryotic genomes, and their ability to transpose, excise and produce complex genomic rearrangements make them a key source of genomic diversity. Previous work done over the last decades has uncovered their enormous potential as gene regulators, a role that TEs play through a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms [12, 43]. Certain TEs, such as Long Terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposon carry their own promoters, and their insertion close to genes can generate new gene expression patterns. In addition, TEs, and in particular LTR-retrotransposons and MITEs (Miniature Inverted Transposable Elements), have been shown to contain transcription factor binding sites, which can be mobilized by transposition rewiring new genes into pre-existing transcriptional networks [5, 12, 20]. As a consequence, TEs have the potentiality to generate important genomic and transcriptional variability, and the interest in these elements has drastically increased in the last years.,Due to their repetitive nature and their sequence diversity, the annotation of TEs is more complex than that of protein coding genes. Nevertheless, thanks to the development of tools such as Repeatmasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) and sophisticated pipelines such as REPET [16], methodologies of TE detection and annotation in assembled genomes are today robust. The availability of high-quality reference genomes coupled with the exponential increment of resequencing data has boosted our capacity to evaluate intraspecific variability. By obtaining accurate maps of genetic variation, characterizing the genetic basis of phenotypic variance is now possible at a genome-wide scale thanks to association studies (GWAS). Until now, most of the efforts have been focused on analyzing the variability at the nucleotide level (SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms), as there are robust algorithms to perform variant calling. However, TEs generate an important part of the genetic variability present in a particular species. Moreover, the timing of occurrence of TE and SNP mutations is different, as the former can amplify in bursts generating a great amount of diversity in short periods of time, whereas SNP mutation rates are more constant in time. Therefore, the identification of Transposon Insertion Polymorphisms (TIPs) is of high interest. Nevertheless, our capacity to accurately identify TIPs using re-sequencing data is hampered by the structural complexity of TEs.,In the last few years, many laboratories have developed bioinformatic tools to look for TIPs and have started to analyze their impact in intra-species variability, including crop plants [7, 10, 42]. There are two main approaches that can be used to detect TIPs in whole-genome sequence data: i) inference from discordant read-pair mappings, and ii) clustering of ‘split’ reads sharing common alignment junctions [2, 15]. Most of the recently developed tools incorporate both methodologies, and in some cases TIPs have been experimentally validated [27]. Moreover, in some cases the authors have evaluated their sensitivity and precision (also known as positive predictive value) [11, 24]. However, in most cases these evaluations were performed by generating simulated insertions that are randomly placed in the genome, and then used to compare with tool predictions. Simulated insertions are far from representing the complexity of “natural” TIPs, as many of their features are difficult or impossible to mimic accurately (i.e.: element degeneration, nested insertions, insertion preferences, etc.). As a consequence, the benchmarks done with simulated data tend to overestimate performance of the tools analyzed [21]. An example of such benchmarks is the one reported by the developers of McClintock, a pipeline that integrates six tools [36] (Table 1). In their study, the authors provided a detailed comparison of their component’s performance in sensitivity and positional accuracy based on simulated LTR-retrotransposon insertions, which also includes some real resequencing data, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In spite of the interest of such comparative analysis, the direct translation of these results to other eukaryotic models with bigger and more repetitive genomes is uncertain. This is especially relevant as S. cerevisiae contains only 51 full LTR-retrotransposons in the whole genome [8], whereas in most plant and animal genomes the LTR-retrotransposon load is several orders of magnitude higher. Also, a recent study focused on simulated but also real human AluY, L1 and SVA families revealed huge differences in the ability of seven tools to detect TIPs [41]. In spite of the importance of these families for human research, they do not represent the diversity of the TE landscape of other animals and plants, which is far more complex, with many families from different orders being potentially active, and where the amount of truncated non-autonomous elements greatly outnumbers the active copies.
,In plants, TEs are at the origin of important agronomic traits, such as apical dominance in maize [45], the skin and flesh colors in grape [28] and blood oranges [4]. Different efforts have been made recently to identify TIPs that could be responsible for important variability in plants. Carpentier et. al [7] screened the presence of 32 rice LTR-retrotransposon families in the 3000-rice genome dataset and uncovered more than 50,000 TIPs, most of them occurring at a very low frequency, which is indicative of recent activity. Besides LTR-retrotransposons, MITEs are probably the most prevalent group of transposons in plants, including rice, where they have experienced recent massive amplification bursts [10, 35]. MITEs are structurally very different from LTR-retrotransposons, as they are non-autonomous, usually non-coding, and relatively small. They are of particular interest because they tend to integrate close to genes and may carry regulatory domains [20], having the potential to create or rewire regulatory networks [12]. In the present study, we have taken advantage of the existence of several high-quality assembled genomes of different rice varieties to create a validated dataset of natural LTR-retrotransposon and MITE insertions obtained by direct comparison between the assembled genomes (Nipponbare and MH63), that we have used to benchmark the performance of 12 TIP calling tools. Moreover, we have also analyzed the sensitivity of the best performing tools to detect experimentally validated TIPs in Drosophila and humans. Our results evidence that tool performance is in general lower than estimated by previous simulations, and highly variable depending on sequencing coverage and TE type. Also, we show that an appropriate combination of tools can increase the sensitivity of predictions while maintaining high precision levels."

                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0192-1,RetrotransposonHigh-throughput sequencingData analysisMappingQuantification,"Sequencing technologies give access to a precise picture of the molecular mechanisms acting upon genome regulation. One of the biggest technical challenges with sequencing data is to map millions of reads to a reference genome. This problem is exacerbated when dealing with repetitive sequences such as transposable elements that occupy half of the mammalian genome mass. Sequenced reads coming from these regions introduce ambiguities in the mapping step. Therefore, applying dedicated parameters and algorithms has to be taken into consideration when transposable elements regulation is investigated with sequencing datasets.,Here, we used simulated reads on the mouse and human genomes to define the best parameters for aligning transposable element-derived reads on a reference genome. The efficiency of the most commonly used aligners was compared and we further evaluated how transposable element representation should be estimated using available methods. The mappability of the different transposon families in the mouse and the human genomes was calculated giving an overview into their evolution.,Based on simulated data, we provided recommendations on the alignment and the quantification steps to be performed when transposon expression or regulation is studied, and identified the limits in detecting specific young transposon families of the mouse and human genomes. These principles may help the community to adopt standard procedures and raise awareness of the difficulties encountered in the study of transposable elements.,Transposable elements (TEs) comprise approximately half of the mammalian genomes [1]. Based on de novo repeat identification, it has been suggested that two-thirds of the human genome is in fact composed of repetitive elements [2].TEs are first classified according to their ability to invade the genome and their related molecular mechanisms. DNA transposons use a cut-and-paste mechanism where the element is excised and inserted into a new locus. Retrotransposons use an intermediate RNA template to insert into new genomic locations, in a copy-and-paste manner. These are classified into Long-Terminal Repeat (LTR) elements that are similar to retroviruses, and non-LTR elements. Non-LTR elements are more abundant compared to LTR elements and DNA transposons in mammalian genomes. The vast majority of TE insertions are incapable of mobilization, due to invalidating truncations, internal rearrangements or mutations. However, based on cell culture assays, it has been estimated that 80–100 L1HS elements are competent for retrotransposition in the human genome [3] and around 3000 L1 elements from the Tf, A and Gf subfamilies are potentially capable of retrotransposition in the mouse genome [4]. De novo insertions of TEs -mainly Alu, L1 and SVA non-LTR families- have been associated with more than 100 human diseases [5]. In reaction, cells have developed several restraining mechanisms against TE activity. At the transcriptional level, DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications block TE expression. In the cytoplasm, some restriction factors degrade retrotransposon RNAs. Other factors play a role in the nucleus by interfering with the DNA integration step [6].,The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies has allowed making tremendous progress in our understanding of the regulation and functional impact of TEs. However, the characterization of these elements remains computationally challenging, mainly due to their repetitiveness [6]. As they are not unique in the genome, repeated sequences create ambiguities in the alignment step, which can lead to misleading biological conclusions if inappropriate parameters are applied [7, 8]. Different algorithms have been developed for the purpose of mapping reads according to the sequencing application [9]. By default, most of these tools are parameterized to randomly report one genomic position among the set of possible alignments. Additional parameters or filters are implemented to keep uniquely mapped reads, to report all possible positions of reads or to return up to a given number of valid alignments. Benchmarkings of these methods have also been reported to compare their efficiency. Some of them investigated specific biological applications, such as Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) [10] and RNA-seq [11] or specific sequencing platforms [12]. Schbath et al. assessed the power of tools to retrieve all the read occurences. However, their study relied on simulated short single-end reads of 40 bp without any insertions/deletions (indels). Hatem et al. investigated the effect of different mapping parameters such as number of mismatches, seed and read length, gapped vs ungapped alignment. Nevertheless, they did not investigate the power of the different algorithms to align TE-derived reads.,Some tools were developed to quantify TEs within sequencing data. TEtools uses TE annotation to create Bowtie2 index and performs mapping by reporting randomly one position [13, 14]. RepEnrich recommends performing the mapping with Bowtie to retrieve unique alignments [15, 16]. It enables quantifying unique reads emanating from specific families (referred to repEnrich Unique in this study) and the total number of reads, unique and multiple, mapped to each TE family (repEnrich Total). The repEnrich Fractional method counts reads that map to a single TE family and assigns multi-mapped reads to corresponding families using a fractional value 1/n, where n is the number of TE families the read maps to. SQuIRE [17] allows quantifying TE single copies and families performing the alignment with STAR [18] and using an iterative method to assign multi-mapped reads (SQuIRE). Finally, TEtranscripts [19] advises to generate BAM files with the STAR mapper, and performs TE quantification using only uniquely-mapped reads (TEtranscripts Unique), or using multi-mapped reads with an iterative method (TEtranscripts Multiple).,In this study, we propose to benchmark at once the efficiency of the most used aligners and available tools for TE quantification. Using simulated data with mouse and human genomes, Bowtie, Bowtie2, STAR, Novoalign (http://www.novocraft.com), BWA aln [20] and mem [21] alignment algorithms were compared. We also assessed the effect of using paired-end library compared to single-end library with TE-derived reads. Reporting unique reads, randomly one position and all possible locations were compared when TE abundance was estimated. In addition, TE quantification was compared to TE-simulated abundance using the most recent and used RepeatMasker-based tools, TEtools, repEnrich, SQuIRE and TEtranscript. Finally, the efficiency to map reads from each TE subfamily within the mouse and the human genome was computed and revealed the difficulties of accessing specific young TE families."
3,A re-evaluation of LINE-1 ORF2 expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells,Published on: 29 December 2019,"Authors: Erica M. Briggs, Corrado Spadafora and Susan K. Logan","
                            We previously examined expression of Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) in a variety of prostate cancer cells including hormone-dependent LNCaP cells. These studies demonstrated expression and sub-cellular l...
                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0196-x,BCLAF1ORF2ORF2 antibodyLINE-1Prostate cancer,"We previously examined expression of Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) in a variety of prostate cancer cells including hormone-dependent LNCaP cells. These studies demonstrated expression and sub-cellular localization of LINE-1 proteins, ORF1p, with antibody 4H1, and ORF2p, with antibody chA1-L1.,Here we conduct immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry analysis using chA1-L1 antibody against ORF2p in LNCaP cells. Our results indicate that antigens detected by the antibody include the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1. We show that chA1-L1 recognizes BCLAF1 using siRNA knockdown and overexpression of a tagged BCLAF1. We also show that chA1-L1 antibody recognizes ORF2p in HEK293 cells overexpressing LINE-1. Further, analysis of ORF2p (chA1-L1) and BCLAF1 foci using immunofluorescence in LNCaP cells showed significant colocalization.,Overall, our findings indicate that chA1-L1 antibody recognizes both BCLAF1 and ORF2p but the majority of antigen recognized in LNCaP cells is BCLAF1.,Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) is the only autonomous mobile element in the human genome. Its ability to mobilize, or retrotranspose, via an RNA intermediate generates additional copies of LINE-1 within the genome [1]. LINE-1 retrotransposition has led to the accumulation of LINE-1 sequences, occupying an estimated 17% of human DNA [2]. LINE-1 mRNA is bicistronic and codes for two proteins necessary for retrotransposition, ORF1p and ORF2p. ORF1p serves as a nucleic acid chaperone, while ORF2p contains endonuclease and reverse transcriptase enzymatic domains active in retrotransposition [3,4,5]. While LINE-1 mRNA has been detected in normal tissue, many mechanisms act to repress LINE-1 activity in somatic tissue to preserve genomic stability [6,7,8,9]. LINE-1 proteins are absent from most healthy somatic tissue, yet, LINE-1 protein expression and mobilization have been observed in a variety of cancers [10,11,12].,In our previous publication, we characterized LINE-1 expression, retrotransposition frequency, and protein localization in prostate cancer cells [13]. Our findings demonstrated most prostate cancer cell lines expressed ORF1p, which was primarily localized in the cytoplasm. We utilized an ectopic retrotransposition assay to assess retrotransposition frequency in prostate cancer cells and found the highest rate of retrotransposition in LNCaP cells, followed by PC3 cells, 22Rv1 cells and very low levels in LAPC4 cells. Additionally, we utilized a newly available ORF2p antibody, chA1-L1, to characterize endogenous ORF2p expression in prostate cancer cells [14]. We demonstrated robust ORF2p expression in many prostate cancer cell lines, most of which was expressed as punctate foci localized in the nucleus. Since ORF2p endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains have the potential to disrupt genomic stability, we hypothesized that prostate cancer cells were actively regulating ORF2p through prostate specific protein-protein interactions in the nucleus. To investigate this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated endogenous ORF2p, using chA1-L1, from LNCaP nuclear lysates and conducted mass spectroscopy to identify ORF2p nuclear interactors. Surprisingly, our mass spectroscopy analysis did not identify any ORF2p peptides despite our western blot demonstrating a successful immunoprecipitation of ORF2p using chA1-L1 (Fig. 1a). Two of the top proteins identified in our mass spectroscopy were paralogous transcriptional regulators, BCLAF1 and THRAP3 (Fig. 1b). Initially, we suspected that our mass spectroscopy analysis was misidentifying ORF2 peptides due to sequence variability. To investigate these puzzling results further, we conducted a Metascape analysis of peptides unique to the ORF2p chA1-L1 immunoprecipitation [15]. Our Metascape analysis identified RNA processing and DNA damage repair pathways (RNA splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, nucleotide excision repair) as top pathways represented in the ORF2p chA1-L1 IP, consistent with ORF2p’s interaction with RNA and potential to induce DNA damage (Fig. 1c) [4, 16, 17]. Additionally, we speculated that ORF2 sequence variability might have contributed to the difficulty identifying ORF2p peptides in our mass spectroscopy analysis [18]. Due to these factors, we investigated the possible interaction between top proteins identified in our screen and ORF2p in LNCaP cells.
,ORF2p/Immunoprecipitation Mass Spectroscopy. a Western blot of endogenous ORF2p immunoprecipitation from LNCaP nuclear extract using the chA1-L1 ORF2p antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were submitted for Mass Spectroscopy (MS) analysis. b Linear regression of chA1-L1 ORF2 IP peptide-spectrum match (PSM) and IgG IP peptide-spectrum match. Thrap3 (blue) and BCLAF1 (red) had two of the highest chA1-L1 PSM values. NUMA1 excluded due to high contamination in IgG control. c Metascape analysis of functional categories enriched in the chA1-L1 ORF2p IP [15],Since BCLAF1 and THRAP3 have both been shown to regulate RNA during DNA damage, we hypothesized that these proteins may play a role in regulating LINE-1 mRNA, thereby limiting LINE-1 protein expression and retrotransposition [19, 20]. To test whether BCLAF1 or THRAP3 had an effect on LINE-1 protein expression, we performed siRNA knockdown of BCLAF1 and THRAP3 in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2a and b). Upon THRAP3 knockdown, we observed a 1.4–1.5 fold increase in LINE-1 ORF1p and 2.6–2.7 fold increase in ORF2p (chA1-L1) expression. However, upon BCLAF1 knockdown, the band for ORF2p was significantly diminished while ORF1p protein levels remained relatively unchanged. Due to this discrepancy between ORF1p and ORF2p protein levels, we further investigated the relationship between BCLAF1 and ORF2p. Since ORF2p and BCLAF1 proteins have similar electrophoretic mobilities, with an apparent molecular weight of ~ 150 kDa, we explored the possibility that the ORF2p antibody, chA1-L1, also recognized BCLAF1 protein. To help distinguish overexpressed from endogenous BCLAF1, we created a BCLAF1 construct with a ~ 35 kDa tag on the N-terminus (Fig. 2c). Whole cell lysates transfected with vector only (VO) or the BCLAF1 tagged construct were run on a western blot and probed with ORF2p chA1-L1 antibody. The ORF2p chA1-L1 antibody detected the shifted band in the tagged BCLAF1 overexpression sample, as well as a lower band in both VO and overexpressed BCLAF1 consistent with the molecular weight of endogenous BCLAF1 protein. These experiments suggest that THRAP3 may play a role modulating LINE-1 mRNA or protein levels (Fig. 2b), however, further investigation is needed to confirm this effect. Additionally, our findings confirm that the ORF2p chA1-L1 antibody detects both overexpressed and endogenous BCLAF1 protein (Fig. 2a and c).
,ORF2p chA1-L1 antibody cross-reacts with BCLAF1. LNCaP cells were treated with Scramble, BCLAF1 (a) or THRAP3 (b) siRNA for 72 h. Whole cell lysates were assayed via western blot and probed with chA1-L1 ORF2p antibody, BCLAF1 or THRAP3, ORF1p, and Tubulin (loading control). Intensity of ORF1 bands in b were normalized to tubulin levels. c) Left: BCLAF1 Tagged overexpression construct with N-terminus 3x flag, V5, and Venus tag (~ 35 kDa). Right: HEK293 cells were transfected with vector only (VO) or tagged BCLAF1 construct. Whole cell lysates were assayed by western blot and probed with ORF2p antibody chA1-L1, and Tubulin (loading control),The question remained whether chA1-L1 solely detects BCLAF1 or whether it detects BCLAF1 and ORF2p. To address this, we performed two immunoprecipitations (IP) of ORF2p using the chA1-L1 antibody and two alternative ORF2p antibodies, MT5 and MT49, developed and generously provided by the laboratory of Kathleen Burns at John Hopkins University (see accompanying manuscript by Burns, LaCava and colleagues, https://doi.org/10.1101/744425). MT5 recognizes the reverse transcriptase domain of ORF2p (epitope QDIGVGKD), while MT49 recognizes the endonuclease domain (epitope DRSTRQ). We first used the ORF2p chA1-L1 antibody to immunoprecipitate endogenous ORF2p from LNCaP whole cell lysate (Fig. 3a, arrow). Western blot analysis showed a strong band at ~ 150 kDa when the IP was probed with the chA1-L1 antibody. A similar pattern was observed when we probed with a BCLAF1 antibody. Further, the BCLAF1 band was diminished in the ORF2p flow through lane suggesting once again that chA1-L1 recognizes BCLAF1. However, ORF1p also co-immunoprecipitated in the chA1-L1 IP, likely indicating that chA1-L1 is also pulling down ORF1p, which is well known to interact with ORF2p through RNA (Fig. 3a) [21]. Since the molecular weight of both BCLAF1 and ORF2p was ~ 150 kDa, we considered the possibility that BCLAF1 was co-immunoprecipitating with ORF2p. To address this, we probed with an alternative ORF2p antibody, MT49 (Burns laboratory, John Hopkins University). However, we did not detect any ORF2p in the input or immunoprecipitation using this antibody. We also tested MT5 antibody to immunoprecipitate overexpressed ORF2p in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3b). MT5 immunoprecipitated a band ~ 150 kDa, likely to be ORF2p. The chA1-L1 antibody also recognized this band, suggesting chA1-L1 also detects ORF2p. No BCLAF1 was detected in the MT5 ORF2p immunoprecipitation. Altogether, these results confirm that the chA1-L1 antibody recognizes both ORF2p and BCALF1 proteins.

Input, flow through, and IPs were run on a western blot and probed for ORF2 (chA1-L1), ORF2 (MT49), BCLAF1, ORF1, and Tubulin (loading control). b HEK293 cells were transfected with LINE-1, a human CMV ORFeus recoded LINE-1 construct. ORF2p MT5 was used for immunoprecipitation of ORF2p in whole cell lysates overexpressing LINE-1. Vector only lysate (VO), and LINE1 (L1) Input, flow through, and IP (from LINE-1 overexpression lysate) were run on a western blot and probed with ORF2p MT5, ORF2p (chA1-L1), BCLAF1, and tubulin (loading control). c Confocal image of LNCaP cells that were probed for ORF2p using chA1-L1 (red), BCLAF1 (green) and nuclei stained with DAPI (Blue). d MultAlin protein alignment of human BCLAF1 and immunizing ORF2 chA1-L1 peptide,In our previous publication, we also demonstrated ORF2p localized to punctate foci in the nucleus. Since we found chA1-L1 also detects BCLAF1, we wanted analyze these foci to see if they were also positive for BCLAF1. We conducted immunofluorescence for ORF2p chA1-L1 (red) and BCLAF1 (green) (Fig. 3c). We found significant co-localization of BCLAF1 and ORF2p foci, most likely representing chA1-L1 detection of BCLAF1. However, not all foci positive for ORF2p were positive for BCLAF1. While it is conceivable that these may be ORF2p foci, we have not eliminated the possibility that these are additional BCLAF1 foci that were not detected by the BCLAF1 antibody or that there are alternative off-target proteins detected by chA1-L1 antibody.,We next conducted protein sequence alignment using MultAlin software to assess whether the chA1-L1 immunizing peptide and BCLAF1 contained sequence similarities [22]. However, only weak sequence similarities were found (Fig. 3d). While we did not detect obvious sequence similarities, it is also possible that protein conformation or epitope spreading resulted in chA1-L1 recognition of BCLAF1.,Advancements in studying endogenous ORF2p have been hindered for many years due to low levels of expression and the lack of a reliable antibody, posing a significant challenge for scientists studying LINE-1. Additional mass spectroscopy, immunohistochemistry, and immunoprecipitation studies have recently confirmed the insurmountable challenge of detecting low levels of ORF2 in tumor samples and cell lines (see accompanying manuscript by Burns, LaCava and colleagues, https://doi.org/10.1101/744425). The development of ORF2p antibody chA1-L1 offered a glimpse into endogenous ORF2p expression, opening the door to understanding LINE-1 ORF2p regulation and activity in cancer cells. While this antibody was previously validated with LINE-1 overexpression and knockdown experiments, our findings show that in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, the chA1-L1 antibody also recognizes BCLAF1. Interestingly, BCLAF1 and its paralogue THRAP3 were both identified in a previous study to interact with LINE-1 proteins [21]. Both proteins were identified by IP mass spectroscopy of ORF1p and ORF2p, yet were not deemed significant by the investigators. It is possible that these proteins were identified in LINE-1 IPs because of their indirect interaction with RNA, or they may play an active role in LINE-1 regulation, a topic in need of further investigation. Additionally, it is unclear why chA1-L1 recognizes both ORF2p and BCLAF1. Yet, due to the similar molecular weight of ORF2p and BCLAF1, and widespread expression of BCLAF1 in other tissues (Human Protein Atlas [23]), it is problematic to use chA1-L1 to investigate ORF2p. Lastly, our findings stress the importance of independently validating all reagents."
4,"Nested plant LTR retrotransposons target specific regions of other elements, while all LTR retrotransposons often target palindromes and nucleosome-occupied regions: in silico study",Published on: 14 December 2019,"Authors: Pavel Jedlicka, Matej Lexa, Ivan Vanat, Roman Hobza and Eduard Kejnovsky","
                            Nesting is common in LTR retrotransposons, especially in large genomes containing a high number of elements.
                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0186-z,Transposable elementsLTR retrotransposonsNestingChromatinNucleosomesPlants,"Nesting is common in LTR retrotransposons, especially in large genomes containing a high number of elements.,We analyzed 12 plant genomes and obtained 1491 pairs of nested and original (pre-existing) LTR retrotransposons. We systematically analyzed mutual nesting of individual LTR retrotransposons and found that certain families, more often belonging to the Ty3/gypsy than Ty1/copia superfamilies, showed a higher nesting frequency as well as a higher preference for older copies of the same family (“autoinsertions”). Nested LTR retrotransposons were preferentially located in the 3’UTR of other LTR retrotransposons, while coding and regulatory regions (LTRs) are not commonly targeted. Insertions displayed a weak preference for palindromes and were associated with a strong positional pattern of higher predicted nucleosome occupancy. Deviation from randomness in target site choice was also found in 13,983 non-nested plant LTR retrotransposons.,We reveal that nesting of LTR retrotransposons is not random. Integration is correlated with sequence composition, secondary structure and the chromatin environment. Insertion into retrotransposon positions with a low negative impact on family fitness supports the concept of the genome being viewed as an ecosystem of various elements.,Transposable elements (TEs) are prolific structural and functional genome components colonizing genomes throughout the whole course of evolution. The plethora of types, mechanisms, modes and rates of spreading, as well as examples of domestication, all underline the importance of TEs for genome rearrangements and cell functioning [1]. Transposable elements are source of mutations, can create genes and RNAs, are epigenetically regulated and can be activated by stress as is especially evident in sessile plants where TEs represent up to 80% of the genome [2, 3].,Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are the most common TE type in the majority of plants. Increasing accumulation of genomic sequence data during last decade enabled identification of new LTR retrotransposons. However, their classification is still being constructed. As with any taxonomic framework, the LTR retrotransposon classification system underwent revisions as diverse elements were identified. Wicker et al. [4, 5] classified Ty1/copia elements into six lineages - Maximus, Ivana, Ale, Angela, TAR and Bianca. Later, Llorens et al. [6, 7] established two lineages belonging to the Ty3/gypsy superfamily - chromovirus (composed of the Del, Reina, CRM and Galadriel clades) and Tat/Athila, and five lineages belonging to the Ty1/copia superfamily - Oryco, Sire, Retrofit, Osser and Tork. Recently, Neumann et al. [8] performed a survey of 13,863 LTR retrotransposons from 80 plant species and established a refined classification system applicable to LTR retrotransposons in plants. They divided the Ty3/gypsy and Ty1/copia elements into 14 and 16 lineages, respectively.,The genomic distribution of transposable elements differs among TE types. At least in plants, Ty3/gypsy elements are much more frequent in heterochromatin (often in centromeres) and show an opposite distribution with respect to genes, whereas Ty1/copia elements in general have a much less skewed distribution. This is the case for example of tomato [9], Arabidopsis [10], wheat [11], barley [12], sorghum [13], or soybean [14].,Some other elements only occur in specific genomic loci - e.g. miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are preferentially found in gene-rich regions, or close to genes [15], Ty5 retrotransposons are integrated into telomeric heterochromatin [16], Mos1 mariner elements prefer TATA or TA motifs [17]. High TE content is characteristic for pericentromeres, TE islands and knobs that are epigenetically maintained in a silenced state forming constitutive heterochromatin (reviewed by [18]). Small genome plants like Arabidopsis have relatively few TE islands, while large genomes such as maize and wheat have greater numbers and expanded sizes of dense TE islands. Specific localization of TEs is a result of both selection processes retaining TEs only in some sites and/or targeting of elements into specific positions.,A high density of transposable elements e.g. in TE islands or knobs, can lead to TE nesting - i.e. the insertion of new elements into pre-existing elements. Extensive nesting was discovered more than two decades ago in maize [19, 20] with later studies showing TEs gathered in the centromeric regions of Arabidopsis thaliana [21], Drosophila [22] and Brassica [23]. Nested insertions are often biased into specific preferential positions and sequence motifs of original transposable elements as was seen in the human [24] and various eukaryotes [25]. For example, human Alu retrotransposons are more often inserted into the same type of elements and the orientation of the incorporated element is also important [24]. However, little is known about the rules governing the nesting of LTR retrotransposons that are especially abundant in plants.,Here we annotated and analyzed 1491 pairs of nested and original LTR retrotransposons from 12 plant genomes to show that nested elements are preferentially localized in specific sites of pre-existing elements."
5,Nucleotide composition of transposable elements likely contributes to AT/GC compositional homogeneity of teleost fish genomes,Published on: 12 December 2019,Authors: Radka Symonová and Alexander Suh,"

This finding might have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the evolution of nucleotide composition across vertebrates. Genomes of fish and amphibians are GC homogenous, with non-teleost gars being the single exception identified to date, whereas birds and mammals are AT/GC heterogeneous. The exact reason for this phenomenon remains controversial. Since TEs make up significant proportions of genomes and can quickly accumulate across genomes, they can potentially influence the host genome with their own GC content (GC%). However, the GC% of fish TEs has so far been neglected.,The genomic proportion of TEs indeed correlates with genome size, although not as linearly as previously shown with fewer genomes, and GC% negatively correlates with genome size in the 33 fish genome assemblies analysed here (excluding salmonids). GC% of fish TE consensus sequences positively correlates with the corresponding genomic GC% in 29 species tested. Likewise, the GC contents of the entire repetitive vs. non-repetitive genomic fractions correlate positively in 54 fish species in Ensembl. However, among these fish species, there is also a wide variation in GC% between the main groups of TEs. Class II DNA transposons, predominant TEs in fish genomes, are significantly GC-poorer than Class I retrotransposons. The AT/GC heterogeneous gar genome contains fewer Class II TEs, a situation similar to fugu with its extremely compact and also GC-enriched but AT/GC homogenous genome.,Our results reveal a previously overlooked correlation between GC% of fish genomes and their TEs. This applies to both TE consensus sequences as well as the entire repetitive genomic fraction. On the other hand, there is a wide variation in GC% across fish TE groups. These results raise the question whether GC% of TEs evolves independently of GC% of the host genome or whether it is driven by TE localization in the host genome. Answering these questions will help to understand how genomic GC% is shaped over time. Long-term accumulation of GC-poor(er) Class II DNA transposons might indeed have influenced AT/GC homogenization of fish genomes and requires further investigation.,Nucleotide composition is a fundamental property of genomes with a strong influence on gene function and regulation [1]. Hence, GC content of a genome (GCG), i.e., the molar ratio of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) in DNA, is one of the main parameters used to describe nucleotide composition and is frequently related to genome size [1]. For practical reasons, genomes can be segmented in five types of regions called isochores according to their GC percentage (GC%). Two “light” isochores with the lowest GC%, i.e., L1 with approx. 34–36% of GC and L2 approx. 37–40% of GC; as well as three “heavy” isochores, i.e., H1 with approx. 41–45% of GC, H2 46–52% and the “heaviest” H3 with > 53% of GC [2]. In this regard, fish and amphibian genomes are overall AT/GC homogenous because they contain only the GC-poor(er) isochores with a substantially narrower range of GC%, i.e., usually only two neighbouring ones such as L1 and L2 or L2 and H1. On the other hand, avian and mammalian genomes contain all five isochores and their broad range of GC% results in overall GC heterogeneity [2].,An increasing number of recent studies in fish has shown a clear positive correlation between genome size and percentage of TEs, and that TEs are ubiquitous and present in large numbers, e.g., refs. [3,4,5,6]. One of these studies [7] documented a surprisingly linear correlation between genome size and TE content in four teleost fish species. A clear but not strictly linear correlation between the percentage of TEs and genome size was identified in a larger dataset of 19 ray-finned and two lobe-finned fish species ([3]; including the four genomes analysed by ref. [7]). The so far most extensive (but still unpublished) study on fish TEs by ref. [5] using in silico explorations of TE activity, diversity and abundance across 74 teleost fish genomes showed that the total genomic TE abundances reflect variation in their host genome size.,Moreover, TEs can be very different in copy numbers and composition [3, 4, 8, 9], which would imply that accumulation or turnover of TE numbers/composition could change genomic GC content (GCG) because of the TEs’ own GC content (GCTE). There are major quantitative and qualitative differences in TEs among vertebrates: Class II DNA transposons are the most abundant group in fish genomes, whereas in avian and mammalian genomes Class I retrotransposons are the most abundant group while DNA transposons are substantially less numerous [3,4,5, 8, 9]. Hence, the GCTE of different mobilomes, i.e., the sum of TEs within a genome, may potentially result in different overall GCG organization in fish when compared with birds and mammals. However, the characteristics of GCTE remains understudied in general, particularly in fish. This is despite the fact that TEs make up 6–55% of the total base pairs of fish genomes, and that TEs are clearly depleted in compact and GC-rich genomes (Takifugu flavidus [9, 10], Tetraodon nigroviridis [11, 12]) while they are massively represented in large and GC-poor genomes such zebrafish (Danio rerio [13]) and cod (Gadus morhua [14]).,The currently known main features of fish mobilomes can be summarized as follows: i. DNA transposons are the predominant group of TEs in fish; ii. the diversity of TE families is generally high in fish; iii. many TEs show recent activity in fish genomes; and iv. the total genomic abundances of TEs reflect the variation in genome size [3,4,5, 15]. Since the dynamics of genome size variation can be largely explained by TEs in many eukaryotes [16, 17] and GCG is negatively linked to genome size in some organisms [1], these findings in fish raise crucial questions about potential roles of TEs in shaping GCG: i. Do TEs have a different GC% than the non-TE regions of the host genome? ii. Do new TE insertions lead to a decrease in GC% in adjacent regions of the host genome because of TE silencing through cytosine methylation? Methylcytosine frequently undergoes spontaneous deamination resulting in point mutation to thymine [18]. iii. Do TEs change local recombination rates (negatively if TEs are heterochromatinized or positively if they contain motifs attracting the recombination machinery [19, 20]) and hence influence the GCG as discussed below? These factors all may contribute to the overall nucleotide compositional landscape, i.e., the heterogeneous organization in birds and mammals in comparison with the homogeneous organization in fish and amphibians. Such manifold effects of TEs might be particularly pronounced in species where TEs comprise a substantial genomic fraction, e.g., zebrafish (D. rerio) [13].,Both the local GCG as well as TE density are linked to the local recombination rate. Evidence to date suggests that TE densities correlate negatively with recombination rate, but the strength of this correlation varies across TE types [20]. At the same time, the currently most plausible explanation of the AT/GC heterogeneity in avian and mammalian genomes is a non-adaptive process called GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), whereby increased GC% is tightly related to an increased recombination rate (recently extensively reviewed by ref. [19]). In mammals and some other vertebrates (but not birds), at least a part of the regional variation in the location of recombination hotspots can be ascribed to the activity of the protein PRDM9 [21].,One may expect that TEs contribute to the length and GC% of noncoding sequences, and continue to do so even long after they are no longer recognizable as TEs. While TE insertions are a major factor in the expansion or turnover of noncoding regions (both introns and intergenic sequences [17, 22]), the potential influence of the GCTE on the host regional GCG has only been comprehensively assessed for the human genome. Around 42% of the human genome is made up of retrotransposons, whereas DNA transposons only account for about 2–3%, and the insertion or accumulation of TEs depends on the isochore region involved [23]. For instance, Alu (the most abundant TE in human) and L1 insertions contribute to the AT/GC heterogeneity of the human genome due to their differential accumulation: Alu SINEs (approx. 50% GCTE in their consensus sequence) reside preferentially in GC-rich regions, whereas L1 LINEs (approx. 37% GCTE in their consensus sequence) reside preferentially in GC-poor regions [24]. Recognizable Alu elements make up 20% of GC-rich regions and 7% of GC-poor regions, whereas recognizable L1 elements make up 5% of GC-rich regions and 20% of GC-poor regions [25]. For fish, a single study briefly investigated the potential correlation between TEs and GC% along T. nigroviridis and D. rerio genomes [26]. However, they did not observe any effect of TEs on GCG in T. nigroviridis and D. rerio. Three studies investigated in detail some unusual examples of GC-rich TEs in crabs [27,28,29] and reported different GC% between DNA transposons of marine and continental species. A bit more is known from plants and their TEs, e.g., Pack-MULEs elements in grasses specifically acquire and amplify GC-rich gene fragments [30].,In this study, we aim to bring a novel viewpoint on the vertebrate nucleotide compositional evolution by analysing the GCTE of fish TEs and assessing their potential contribution to the GCG and the overall nucleotide compositional landscape of their host genomes."

LTR_FINDER is a widely used program for the identification of LTR retrotransposons but its application on large genomes is hindered by its single-threaded processes. Here we report an accessory program that allows parallel operation of LTR_FINDER, resulting in up to 8500X faster identification of LTR elements. It takes only 72 min to process the 14.5 Gb bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome in comparison to 1.16 years required by the original sequential version. LTR_FINDER_parallel is freely available at https://github.com/oushujun/LTR_FINDER_parallel.,Transposable elements (TEs) are the most prevalent components in eukaryotic genomes. Among different TE classes, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), is one of the most repetitive TEs due to their high copy numbers and large element sizes [1]. LTR retrotransposons are found in almost all eukaryotes including plants, fungi, and animals, but are most abundant in plant genomes [2]. For example, LTR retrotransposons contribute more than 65 and 70% to the genomes of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) and maize (Zea mays), respectively [1].,Annotation of LTR retrotransposons relies primarily on de novo approaches due to their highly diverse terminal repeats. For this purpose, many computational programs have been developed in the past two decades. LTR_FINDER is one of the most popular LTR search engines [3], and the prediction quality out-performs counterpart programs [1]. However, LTR_FINDER runs on a single thread and is prohibitively slow for large genomes with long contigs, preventing its application in those species. In this study, we applied the “divide and conquer” approach to simplify and parallel the annotation task for the original LTR_FINDER and observed an up to 8500 times speedup for analysis of known genomes."

              ","Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are small non-autonomous DNA transposons that are ubiquitous in plant genomes, and are mobilised by their autonomous relatives. Stowaway MITEs are derived from and mobilised by elements from the mariner superfamily. Those elements constitute a significant portion of the carrot genome; however the variation caused by Daucus carota Stowaway MITEs (DcStos), their association with genes and their putative impact on genome evolution has not been comprehensively analysed.,Fourteen families of Stowaway elements DcStos occupy about 0.5% of the carrot genome. We systematically analysed 31 genomes of wild and cultivated Daucus carota, yielding 18.5 thousand copies of these elements, showing remarkable insertion site polymorphism. DcSto element demography differed based on the origin of the host populations, and corresponded with the four major groups of D. carota, wild European, wild Asian, eastern cultivated and western cultivated. The DcStos elements were associated with genes, and most frequently occurred in 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Individual families differed in their propensity to reside in particular segments of genes. Most importantly, DcSto copies in the 2 kb regions up- and downstream of genes were more frequently associated with open reading frames encoding transcription factors, suggesting their possible functional impact. More than 1.5% of all DcSto insertion sites in different host genomes contained different copies in exactly the same position, indicating the existence of insertional hotspots. The DcSto7b family was much more polymorphic than the other families in cultivated carrot. A line of evidence pointed at its activity in the course of carrot domestication, and identified Dcmar1 as an active carrot mariner element and a possible source of the transposition machinery for DcSto7b.,Stowaway MITEs have made a substantial contribution to the structural and functional variability of the carrot genome.,Transposable elements (TEs) are discrete segments of DNA capable of changing their genomic location in a process called transposition [1]. Based on the mechanism of transposition, TEs are divided into two classes, class I (retrotransposons), mobilised via an RNA intermediate, use a ‘copy and paste’ mechanism, while class II (DNA transposons) are mobilised by ‘cut and paste’ or ‘copy and paste’ mechanisms of DNA that do not require a reverse transcription step. In both classes, there are autonomous elements that possess enzyme-encoding genes required for mobilisation, non-autonomous elements which can still be mobilised by their autonomous counterparts, and inactive defective copies [2].,Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are small in size (< 800 base pairs, bp), usually AT-rich sequences with no coding capacity. They are mobilised by related autonomous class II trans-acting elements. Despite their small size, they may account for a significant portion of plant genomes, representing up to 10 and 13.8% for rice and mulberry, respectively [3, 4]. This extremely efficient proliferation of MITEs, as compared to their ancestral autonomous elements, might be caused by their higher affinity for transposase, resulting from lower cis-requirements for enzyme recognition and by the presence of subterminal and/or internal enhancers of nucleoprotein complex formation [5, 6]. Some MITEs families, such as mPing elements in rice, may preferentially target single-copy gene-rich regions [7], and escape the epigenetic control system because MITE-derived trans-acting siRNAs do not share sequence similarity with the coding region of the source of the transposase [8]. All these features, coupled with their small size, make them abundant in plant genomes, and frequently present in the vicinity of genes.,Currently, the pivotal role of TEs in the evolution of plant genomes is becoming more widely recognised. Mobilisation of TEs leads to structural variations that contribute to the genomic diversity of their host, some of which can be adaptive. Among other effects, the role of TE insertional hotspots in the formation of biosynthetic gene clusters was proposed, based on the analysis of genes of the terpene biosynthesis pathway in eudicots [9]. TE insertions can impact gene expression in many ways. By insertion upstream, within, or downstream of coding regions, TEs may provide new regulatory features that can affect gene expression [10]. In addition, RNA-directed methylation (RdDM), which has a role in repetitive DNA control and defense against viruses, can lead to epigenetic changes upon TE insertion that may produce epialleles for adjacent genes [11]. In crops, such modifications can affect agronomically important traits, such as observed with flowering time variation due to MITE insertions into the quantitative trait locus Vegetative to generative transition 1 (Vgt1) [12].,Therefore, one of the main challenges of crop genomics is to critically evaluate the extent of species-wide TE-associated structural variation (TEASV), in order to better understand the dynamics of genome evolution. Several bioinformatics tools have been developed that allow for the identification of TEASV from resequencing data generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) (reviewed in [13]). However, only a few genome-wide comparative analyses of TEASV have been published, almost exclusively for autogamous species. Moreover, most of these were focused on the global TE landscape, and thus they were biased towards the most numerous TE families.,TE-derived variants are also sources of functional variation, as shown by TE variants linked to changes in DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana [14] and flowering traits in maize [15, 16]. A study associating TE-derived variants with phenotypic traits related to maize adaptation to a temperate climate revealed more candidate genes than analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms [16]. This suggests that TEs may be able to quickly enhance host adaptability under adverse environmental conditions. An adaptive role for TEs has also been suggested for A. thaliana [17] and Capsella rubella [18].,To date, only a few reports have focused on the global analysis of MITEs at the species level. Mining of MITEs in 19 A. thaliana ecotypes yielded a total of 2406 copies grouped into 212 families [19]. In another report, 20 MITE families were annotated in B. rapa, B. oleracea, and A. thaliana. Of these, only four were present in A. thaliana, indicating that amplification and diversification of most Brassica MITE families took place after divergence of the Arabidopsis and Brassica lineages. Moreover, some MITE families were significantly enriched in B. rapa and B. oleracea; therefore, they were likely activated after divergence of those species [20]. Rice mJing elements were frequently inserted into introns (16.67%) and into the 2 kb regions flanking genes (45.83%) [21]. Rice accessions differ dramatically in terms of mJing copy number, ranging from 18 to 150 in japonica and African cultivated rice, respectively. This suggested multiple amplification bursts, which most likely occurred before the amplification burst of mPing, another well-characterised active MITE in rice [21]. Some rice lines showed a sharp increase of mPing copies, from less than 10 copies in indica to 1000 in a temperate japonica cultivar Gimbozu EG4 [22]. Association of MITE insertions with coding regions was also shown for 18 wheat Stowaway element families, with 5.1% of more than 19,000 MITEs being transcribed, and 52–63% insertion sites being located within 100 bp of genes [23, 24]. A comparative analysis revealed specific proliferation of two MITE families in the A genome and one in the B genome, suggesting their possible impact on genome diversification during speciation [23].,Carrot (Daucus carota) is a diploid species with 2n = 2x = 18, and a relatively small genome of 473 Mb [25]. It is an allogamous species, suffering from inbreeding depression. Cultivated carrot is a biennial root vegetable and the most economically important species of the Apiaceae family, and is grown around the world in temperate and subtropical regions [26]. D. carota has been domesticated relatively recently, about 1100 years ago. Wild carrot is widespread in temperate regions of the world. While the Mediterranean basin is considered the centre of biodiversity for Daucus spp. [27], Central Asia has been identified as the place of origin of domesticated carrots [25, 28]. The species has four major structural groups: European wild D. carota, which show remarkable morphological diversity and are grouped into several subspecies, referred to as D. carota complex; Asian wild D. carota subsp. carota; eastern cultivated carrots, which are mostly primitive landraces, often producing yellow or purple storage roots; and western cultivated carrots, which include advanced orange cultivars. Cultivated and wild carrots can easily hybridise, and a considerable amount of genetic variation is exhibited both between and within the groups, with no apparent signature of a domestication bottleneck [28].,The carrot reference genome assembly of a double haploid plant (DH1) has been published recently [25]. The repetitive fraction constituted 46% of this carrot genome. DNA transposons comprised 13.6% of the genome and 30% of the total repetitive DNA. Approximately 2.3% of the assembled portion of the genome was attributed to MITEs, of which Stowaway-like elements constituted around 0.5% [25]. Carrot Stowaway-like MITEs (DcStos) had previously been reported to be abundant and highly polymorphic [25, 29]. In this current study, we used 14 DcSto families for a systematic genome-wide analysis of TEASVs in 31 resequenced genomes from cultivated and wild carrot accessions. The accessions were representative of the four structural groups of D. carota, as described above. DcSto insertions were comprehensively annotated and their chromosomal distribution was analysed. In addition, we identified a DcSto family likely active in cultivated carrot."

Primate specific Alu retrotransposons are well-established genomic markers for the study of phylogenetic and population genetic relationships. We previously reported a computational reconstruction of Papio phylogeny using large-scale whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of Alu insertion polymorphisms. Recently, high coverage WGS was generated for Theropithecus gelada. The objective of this study was to apply the high-throughput “poly-Detect” method to computationally determine the number of Alu insertion polymorphisms shared by T. gelada and Papio, and vice versa, by each individual Papio species and T. gelada. Secondly, we performed locus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on a diverse DNA panel to complement the computational data.,We identified 27,700 Alu insertions from T. gelada WGS that were also present among six Papio species, with nearly half (12,956) remaining unfixed among 12 Papio individuals. Similarly, each of the six Papio species had species-indicative Alu insertions that were also present in T. gelada. In general, P. kindae shared more insertion polymorphisms with T. gelada than did any of the other five Papio species. PCR-based genotype data provided additional support for the computational findings.,Our discovery that several thousand Alu insertion polymorphisms are shared by T. gelada and Papio baboons suggests a much more permeable reproductive barrier between the two genera then previously suspected. Their intertwined evolution likely involves a long history of admixture, gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting.,The phylogenetic position of the gelada (Theropithecus gelada) has been debated since the species was first scientifically described in 1835 by Rüppell. Originally named Macacus gelada, it was later placed in a genus of its own by I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1843) [1] where it remains today as the only extant species of Theropithecus [2]. By contrast, there are currently six recognized species of Papio baboons distributed across most of sub-Saharan Africa [3,4,5]. Evidence from morphological comparisons and mitochondrial and whole genome sequencing (WGS) all support a primary phylogenetic division into northern (P. anubis, P. papio and P. hamadryas) and southern (P. ursinus, P. cynocephalus and P. kindae) clades [5,6,7]. The genetics of the baboon species complex have been studied much more extensively [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14] than that of the mountain dwelling geladas of the Ethiopian highlands [15,16,17,18,19,20]. Theropithecus is estimated to have diverged from a Papio-like ancestor about 4–5 million years ago (mya) based on fossil evidence [2, 4, 21, 22] and analysis of mitochondrial DNA [23], while extant Papio species began to diversify about 2 mya [5, 7, 9, 24].,A complex history of evolution has been reported among extant species within the genus Papio [5,6,7, 25,26,27,28], in which mitochondrial and phenotypically-based phylogenies of the six currently recognized extant species frequently conflict. Recently, the Baboon Genome Analysis Consortium published a study of the complex population history of Papio baboons based on whole genome sequences, providing evidence for multiple episodes of introgression and admixture throughout radiation of the genus and a long history of genetic exchange among diverging lineages that were presumably phenotypically distinct [6].,Primate specific Alu retrotransposons are well-established genomic markers for the study of population genetic and phylogenetic relationships [27, 29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40]. Alu element insertions are considered unique events, have a known directionality where the ancestral state is known to be the absence of the element, and are relatively inexpensive to genotype [33, 41,42,43,44,45]. Alu insertions shared by individuals or species are widely accepted as largely being inherited from a common ancestor. The amplification of Alu elements has been ongoing in primate genomes since the origin of the Order, about 65 mya [42, 46, 47]. Alu elements mobilize via a “copy and paste” mechanism through an RNA intermediate, a process termed “target-primed reverse transcription” (TPRT) [48]. We recently reported a computational reconstruction of Papio phylogeny using 187,000 Alu insertions identified through a large-scale whole genome sequence analysis [26]. This study not only determined the most likely branching order within Papio with high statistical support, but also quantified the number of Alu insertions supporting alternative topologies, demonstrating the efficacy of whole genome computational analysis of Alu polymorphisms to identify and investigate complexities in phylogenetic relationships.,During the early stages of the Baboon Genome Analysis Consortium [6] an analysis of the [Panu_2.0] genome of Papio anubis revealed an occasional Alu element insertion that appeared to be present in T. gelada DNA based on PCR, while also remaining polymorphic among the six Papio species. Although intriguing given the estimated 4–5 mya divergence between the two genera, with no other WGS data available at the time for further computational screening, these insertions were set aside as being uninformative for resolving phylogenetic relationships within Papio. Recently, we have generated high coverage WGS data for an individual Theropithecus gelada (Sample name 36168, BioProject PRJNA251424, submitted by Baylor College of Medicine). Therefore, the objective of this study was to apply the “polyDetect” method [26] to computationally determine the number of Alu insertion polymorphisms shared by the representative T. gelada genome and 12 individuals representing the genus Papio. Our approach targeted recently integrated Alu insertions present in T. gelada yet polymorphic within Papio and absent from rhesus macaque [Mmul8.0.1]. Alu insertions recent enough to remain polymorphic among Papio species would be expected to have integrated after the split from Theropithecus and therefore be absent from Theropithecus. Similarly, Theropithecus, with a much smaller effective population size [20], would be expected to have its own set of lineage-specific insertions. Observations of a large number of Alu insertions present in both genera that remain unfixed in all species would suggest a long history of ancient admixture, extensive incomplete lineage sorting, or on-going hybridization [44]. Here, we have computationally ascertained a dataset of Alu insertions present in the Theropithecus gelada WGS data that also remained polymorphic among 12 Papio baboons representing all six species. This analysis prompted a reciprocal computational comparison of WGS of each Papio individual to determine the number of Alu insertion polymorphisms shared exclusively between each Papio species and T. gelada.,Locus specific PCR analyses were performed on a DNA panel which included samples from all six Papio species, T. gelada and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) as an outgroup to provide experimental support for the computational findings."

Several families have been identified; however, exploring the diversity of this superfamily and updating its classification is still ongoing in the life sciences.,Here we identified a new family of Tc1/mariner transposons, named Incomer (IC), which is close to, but distinct from the known family DD34E/Tc1. ICs have a total length of about 1.2 kb, and harbor a single open reading frame encoding a ~ 346 amino acid transposase with a DD36E motif and flanked by short terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) (22–32 base pairs, bp). This family is absent from prokaryotes, and is mainly distributed among vertebrates (141 species of four classes), including Agnatha (one species of jawless fish), Actinopterygii (132 species of ray-finned fish), Amphibia (four species of frogs), and Mammalia (four species of bats), but have a restricted distribution in invertebrates (four species in Insecta and nine in Arachnida). All ICs in bats (Myotis lucifugus, Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis davidii, and Myotis brandtii) are present as truncated copies in these genomes, and most of them are flanked by relatively long TIRs (51–126 bp). High copy numbers of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) derived from ICs were also identified in bat genomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ICs are more closely related to DD34E/Tc1 than to other families of Tc1/mariner (e.g., DD34D/mariner and DD × D/pogo), and can be classified into four distinct clusters. The host and IC phylogenies and pairwise distance comparisons between RAG1 genes and all consensus sequences of ICs support the idea that multiple episodes of horizontal transfer (HT) of ICs have occurred in vertebrates. In addition, the discovery of intact transposases, perfect TIRs and target site duplications of ICs suggests that this family may still be active in Insecta, Arachnida, frogs, and fish.,Exploring the diversity of Tc1/mariner transposons and revealing their evolutionary profiles will help provide a better understanding of the evolution of DNA transposons and their impact on genomic evolution. Here, a newly discovered family (DD36E/Incomer) of Tc1/mariner transposons is described in animals. It displays a similar structural organization and close relationship with the known DD34E/Tc1 elements, but has a relatively narrow distribution, indicating that DD36E/IC might have originated from the DD34E/Tc1 family. Our data also support the hypothesis of horizontal transfer of IC in vertebrates, even invading one lineage of mammals (bats). This study expands our understanding of the diversity of Tc1/mariner transposons and updates the classification of this superfamily.,Fragments of DNA sequences, which can autonomously replicate and translocate between chromosomes, are called transposable elements (TEs) or transposons. The first transposon was discovered by Barbara McClintock in maize [1]. They were subsequently detected in various organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and insects. Based on their mechanism of transposition, TEs can be divided into two major classes: class I transposons transpose by RNA (also called retrotransposons); and class II transposons transpose by DNA (also called DNA transposons). Class II transposons can be further divided into three subcategories: the classical “cut-and-paste” DNA transposons, “rolling circle” DNA transposons, and “self-synthesizing” DNA transposons [2]. For a long time, transposons were designated as “junk DNA” in the genome and ignored. However, with the completion of large-scale genome sequencing projects, transposons have been found to exist in almost all genomes. It is now believed that TEs play important roles in genomic evolution and are regarded as important factors in determining genome expansion. They can simultaneously modify gene structures, provide sources of regulatory sequences [3, 4], and have important impacts on the structure and evolution of the genes of eukaryotes [5, 6].,Tc1/mariner is an important superfamily of “cut-and-paste” transposons, which was first discovered in Drosophila mauritiana [7, 8]. Elements in this superfamily are generally 1300–2400 base pairs (bp) in size and encode a 340-amino acid (aa) transposase that is flanked by TIRs and a TA target site duplication (TSD) at each end [9]. Tc1/mariner transposases contain a DNA-binding domain (DBD), which harbors two helix–turn–helix (HTH) motifs [10], a conserved GRPR-like sequence between the two HTH motifs [11], and a conserved catalytic amino acid triad motif (DDE/D), which usually interacts with a divalent cation (Mg+ 2 or Mn+ 2) to perform the biochemical steps of the transposition reaction [12]. The distance between the first two “D” amino acids is variable across different transposase families, while the distance between the “D” and the third “D/E” is highly conserved. Accordingly, the length of this spacer has been used to characterize this transposase family [13]. Regarding variations of the DDE/D signature motif, Tc1/mariner elements have been classified into eight distinct families: DD34E/Tc1, DD34D/mariner, DD37E/TRT, DD37D/maT, DD39D, DD × D/pogo, DD41D, and DD × E [14]. Although many Tc1/mariner transposons have been identified in nature, only a few naturally active Tc1/mariner transposons have been discovered, such as Thm3 [15], Tc1 [16], Tc3 [17], and Mos1 [18]. This is because insertion of the transposon results in instability of the genome; therefore, long-term purifying natural selection, genetic drift, and mutations can result in gradual inactivation or even disappearance of transposons within the host genome [19, 20]. In addition, studies have shown that horizontal transfer (HT) of transposons is an important way to avoid inactivation and extinction. The HT of transposons between species is considered to be an important driver of genomic variation and biological innovation [21]. Almost all kinds of eukaryotic superfamily TEs have been proved to be capable of HT [21], while the Tc1/mariner superfamily seems to be more prone to this behavior [22]. More than 1200 HT events of Tc1/mariner have been reported to date [23].,Gaining further insight into the evolutionary profile of Tc1/mariner transposons will provide a better understanding of DNA transposon evolution and their impact on genome evolution. Here, we uncovered a new family of Tc1/mariner transposons, which is closely related to the DD34E/Tc1 family, but forms a distinct clade and harbors a DD36E motif in its DDE domain. We also report the taxonomic distribution of ICs, describe the structural organization of these elements, and provide evidence to support the occurrence of HT among vertebrates, and the invasion of this family in one lineage of mammals (bats)."

Such studies may have therefore provided a limited picture of how transposable elements evolve across eukaryotes. The choanoflagellates, as the sister group to Metazoa, are an important study group for investigating unicellular to multicellular transitions. A previous survey of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis revealed the presence of only three families of LTR retrotransposons, all of which appeared to be active. Salpingoeca rosetta is the second choanoflagellate to have its whole genome sequenced and provides further insight into the evolution and population biology of transposable elements in the closest relative of metazoans.,Screening the genome revealed the presence of a minimum of 20 TE families. Seven of the annotated families are DNA transposons and the remaining 13 families are LTR retrotransposons. Evidence for two putative non-LTR retrotransposons was also uncovered, but full-length sequences could not be determined. Superfamily phylogenetic trees indicate that vertical inheritance and, in the case of one family, horizontal transfer have been involved in the evolution of the choanoflagellates TEs. Phylogenetic analyses of individual families highlight recent element activity in the genome, however six families did not show evidence of current transposition. The majority of families possess young insertions and the expression levels of TE genes vary by four orders of magnitude across families. In contrast to previous studies on TEs, the families present in S. rosetta show the signature of selection on codon usage, with families favouring codons that are adapted to the host translational machinery. Selection is stronger in LTR retrotransposons than DNA transposons, with highly expressed families showing stronger codon usage bias. Mutation pressure towards guanosine and cytosine also appears to contribute to TE codon usage.,S. rosetta increases the known diversity of choanoflagellate TEs and the complement further highlights the role of horizontal gene transfer from prey species in choanoflagellate genome evolution. Unlike previously studied TEs, the S. rosetta families show evidence for selection on their codon usage, which is shown to act via translational efficiency and translational accuracy.,Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive mobile DNA sequences that are components of the majority of eukaryotic genomes. TEs can be categorised into two classes, distinguished by their method of transposition. Class I elements are retrotransposons, which transpose via an RNA intermediate; the retrotransposons can be further categorised by the presence or absence of long terminal repeats (LTRs), which flank the 5’and 3′ end of the element. Autonomous retrotransposons contain gag and pol open reading frames (ORFs) which respectively encode structural and enzymatic proteins that facilitate transposition. LTR retrotransposons may also exist as solo LTRs, due to recombination between the two LTR sequences of an individual element which results in the removal of an LTR sequence and the internal, coding DNA. Class II TEs are DNA transposons which transpose as a DNA copy, often by a “cut and paste” mechanism that results in the entire element being removed from the host chromosome and reinserted into a new position in the genome. This process is facilitated by a Transposase (Tnpase) protein for most DNA transposons, which binds to flanking inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) creating double-stranded breaks and allowing the integration of the transposon at a new genomic location.,TEs are major drivers of mutation within their host populations and, as such, individual copies may be subject to negative selection. Selection may operate against insertion mutations or ectopic recombination rearrangements [1, 2]. In addition, as a result of the metabolic burden of TE activity, selection may also operate against the transposition process itself [3].,To date TEs have predominantly been studied in multicellular organisms, with comparatively limited research into unicellular eukaryotes. A number of studies have investigated aspects of TE evolution within species across known eukaryotic diversity, including unicellular opisthokonts, amoebozoans, alveolates, stramenopiles and excavates [4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Such studies have concentrated on the diversity of TEs present in the host genome and the use of phylogenetics to determine the evolutionary origin of the families. The population biology of the TEs in unicellular eukaryotes has received less attention. However phylogenetic evidence for recent transposition has been shown in the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki [4] and purifying selection on the amino acid sequences of TE proteins has been reported in the parabasalid Trichomonas vaginalis [9] as well as the the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis [10]. In addition, gene expression studies have also shown that TE proteins are transcribed in the latter two species.,The eukaryotic supergroup Opisthokonta is composed of two major lineages in the Holozoa and Holomycota [11, 12]. The holozoans include Metazoa, as well as their unicellular relatives Choanoflagellatea, Filasteria, Ichthyosporea and Pluriformea [13]; Fungi and the nuclearioid amoebae make up the Holomycota [14]. Within Holozoa, choanoflagellates are the closest living known relatives to the metazoans, and provide insight into the origin of animals [15]. All choanoflagellates have unicellular stages in their lifecycle, however many species can develop ephemeral multicellular colonies [see 16 for a thorough review of the group].,M. brevicollis was the first unicellular holozoan to have its genome sequenced [17], allowing a study of its TEs. Only three families were identified, all of which were LTR retrotransposons [10]. The same study also screened available EST sequences from a second choanoflagellate, Mylnosiga fluctuans (erroneously described as Monosiga ovata [18]), uncovering LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons in addition to DNA transposons, suggesting that M. brevicollis may be atypical in having a limited diversity of TE families [10]. Further insight into the evolution of TEs in holozoan protists was provided by the genome analysis of C. owczarzaki [4]. The genome harboured 23 TE families, all of which were identified as having orthologous families in Metazoa and Fungi, indicating that the common ancestor of the opisthokonts had a diverse repertoire of mobile elements. Despite the difference in the number of families identified within the genomes of M. brevicollis and C. owczarzaki, copy numbers for individual families were similar across both species with all families being reported as possessing fewer than 100 copies. One notable difference between M. brevicollis and C. owczarzaki was the finding that all families in the former are active, whereas the latter contains at least one family that is no longer functional.,The degenerate nature of the genetic code results in all amino acids, with the exceptions of methionine and tryptophan, being encoded by more than one synonymous codon. Clark [19] predicted that a variety of forces may interact to dictate the non-random usage of codons and subsequent studies in a broad range of eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses have shown that codon usage tends to show a bias in most genes [20, 21]. The degree of bias in any given gene can be calculated using the “effective number of codons” (Nc) statistic [22]. Values range from 20, where all amino acids only use a single synonymous codon, to 61 where each amino acid uses all synonymous codons equally. Any direction of bias may then be determined using GC3s, which is the measure of the proportion of guanosine and cytosine at synonymous third positions.,Codon usage bias may be determined by genetic drift, mutational pressure, selection for translationally optimal codons [23, 24], or a combination of the three forces. In species with a large effective population size (Ne), selection tends to be the dominant force; however, in species with smaller effective population sizes, mutational pressure and drift may act to swamp any selective advantage for optimal codons [25]. Selection for translationally optimal codons may operate through efficiency, allowing the rapid synthesis of polypeptides [26], and accuracy, which reduces the likelihood of misincorporated amino acids [27]. The degree to which the codon usage of a gene shows adaptation to the host optimal codons can be calculated using the frequency of optimal codons (Fop), which is the total number of optimal codons divided by the total number of codons in the sequence [23].,Patterns of relative synonymous codon usage for genes in S. rosetta and M. brevicollis, both of which are craspedid choanoflagellates [28], were established by Southworth et al. [29]. This study identified the suite of 23 translationally optimal codons for S. rosetta and 24 optimal codons for M. brevicollis, which are predominantly GC-ending. Selection was shown to operate at the level of both translational accuracy and efficiency.,Past studies on TE codon usage bias have mainly failed to detect the action of natural selection; rather transposon and retrotransposon families, as well as LTR retroviruses, in a range of organisms show codon usage patterns similar to weakly expressed host genes and a slight excess of AT-ending codons [30,31,32,33]. One reported exception is the LTR retrotransposons of the stramenopile genus Phytophthora [34]. TE families within this group of unicellular eukaryotes were shown to have a preference for GC-ending codons that mirrors host genes; furthermore, high copy number families tended to show stronger codon usage bias than families with lower copy number. The study did not determine which, if any, of the Phytophthora codons were optimal codons or if the higher frequency of GC-ending codons was a result of the use of optimal codons. Due to the emphasis on multicellular eukaryotes within TE research, it is unknown if the putative selection observed on codon usage in Phytophthora families is commonplace or highly unusual within unicellular eukaryotes.,As the translationally optimal codons in S. rosetta mainly show guanosine or cytosine at synonymous sites, any selection for codon usage in the TE families should contrast sharply with the weak bias towards AT-ending codons previously observed in the majority of eukaryotic TEs. S. rosetta therefore provides an opportunity to determine if selection for codon usage is present in the TE families of unicellular eukaryotes other than those previously recorded in Phytophthora.,The presented study screened the genome of S. rosetta in order to identify the species’ TE complement. The TE families were phylogenetically analysed in an attempt to determine their evolutionary history. Evidence for recent element activity was gained through phylogenetic analyses of individual element insertions within the S. rosetta genome. The forces controlling codon usage within the TE genes were analysed to determine if selection for optimal codons was operating and if there was a contribution due to mutation pressure."

              VHICA","The use of large-scale genomic analyses has resulted in an improvement of transposable element sampling and a significant increase in the number of reported HTT (horizontal transfer of transposable elements) events by expanding the sampling of transposable element sequences in general and of specific families of these elements in particular, which were previously poorly sampled. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of HTT events in a group of elements that, until recently, were uncommon among the HTT records in Drosophila – the Jockey elements, members of the LINE (long interspersed nuclear element) order of non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons. The sequences of 111 Jockey families deposited in Repbase that met the criteria of the analysis were used to identify Jockey sequences in 48 genomes of Drosophilidae (genus Drosophila, subgenus Sophophora: melanogaster, obscura and willistoni groups; subgenus Drosophila: immigrans, melanica, repleta, robusta, virilis and grimshawi groups; subgenus Dorsilopha: busckii group; genus/subgenus Zaprionus and genus Scaptodrosophila).,Phylogenetic analyses revealed 72 Jockey families in 41 genomes. Combined analyses revealed 15 potential HTT events between species belonging to different genera and species groups of Drosophilidae, providing evidence for the flow of genetic material favoured by the spatio-temporal sharing of these species present in the Palaeartic or Afrotropical region.,Our results provide phylogenetic, biogeographic and temporal evidence of horizontal transfers of the Jockey elements, increase the number of rare records of HTT in specific families of LINE elements, increase the number of known occurrences of these events, and enable a broad understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of these elements and the host species.,Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant mobile repetitive sequences in eukaryotes that are capable of moving from one place to another in the genome. The introduction of a TE into a naïve genome may occur by three mechanisms: (i) de novo, by means of recombination between pre-existing and degraded TE sequences that restores their coding capacity and transpositional activity; (ii) introgression of sequences consequent to reproduction between closely related species; and (iii) horizontal transfer (HT) of TE sequences between different species via a non-sexual route. After such introduction, the TEs can proliferate both throughout the host genome and throughout the population by vertical transfer (VT) from parents to offspring. During this phase, it is possible for the TE to be transferred horizontally to another genome or lost as a result of random processes or of purifying selection due to deleterious effects of the insertion (for a review, see [1,2,3]). TEs may escape extinction during vertical transmission across generations if HT occurs [4].,Horizontal transfer of TEs (HTT), a quite frequent phenomenon in prokaryotes, has been increasingly documented in eukaryotes. Among the events recorded in metazoans, most are reported in Drosophilidae, a Diptera family widely used to study TEs since their discovery as important sources of genetic variability and genomic evolution. Since the first report of HTT in the 1980s, i.e., the transfer of the P element from Drosophila willistoni to D. melanogaster [5, 6], the number of such studies in drosophilids has increased, doubling from 101 in 2008 (reviewed in [1, 2]) to 218 in 2010 [3], and 243 reports are currently documented [7, 8]. This increasing frequency illustrates how advances in comparative analyses of complete genomes improved the probability of HTT identification and revealed that the rate of HTT is variable between the different types of TEs. Of the 243 cases reported, 126 (51.9%) are of DNA transposons, 103 (42.4%) are of LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, and only 14 (5.8%) involve non-LTR retrotransposons. For non-LTR retrotransposons in particular, only six families of the LINE order are involved, such as Jockey (D. melanogaster/D. funebris), F (D. melanogaster/D. yakuba), Doc (D. melanogaster/D. yakuba), I (D. simulans/D. melanogaster) (reviewed in [1, 2, 8]; HTT-DB platform), and Helena and BS (melanogaster complex/subgenus Zaprionus) [9]. The same marked difference in the HTT rate of different types of TEs was also recently detected by Reiss et al. [10], in a study of 460 species covering 19 orders of arthropods that focused on one LTR retrotransposon (Copia), one non-LTR retrotransposon (Jockey) and one DNA transposon (Mariner). The authors found that the HTT rate of three widely distributed TE superfamilies in Arthropoda, namely, Mariner (DNA transposons), Copia (LTR retrotransposons) and Jockey (non-LTR retrotransposons), which differ in their transposition mode, was 52, 37 and 10%, respectively. Interestingly, in contrast to having a low HTT rate, the Jockey superfamily is the most diverse in terms of the number of families in each genome (~ 15 families on average per species versus 4 and 3.5 for Copia and Mariner, respectively) and species distribution (252 species versus 174 and 129 for Copia and Mariner, respectively). Also interesting is that although arthropods generally present a low rate of HTT, butterflies and moths show a large excess of HTT: 56 events in Lepidoptera compared with the expected average of 13.7. In contrast, only two events were registered in Drosophilidae, one involving D. melanogaster and the other in D. kikkawai, two species belonging to the melanogaster group of the genus Drosophila.,Jockey is a superfamily of non-LTR retrotransposons found only in Arthropoda. The full-length element is ~ 5 kb in size [11, 12] and is formed by two ORFs (open reading frames), the first with 568 aa residues and the second with 916 aa residues. In contrast to ORF1, ORF2, which encodes an apurinic endonuclease (APE) and a reverse transcriptase (RT), is well conserved, shows tree-like evolution [13] and is very appropriate for phylogenetic analyses. The low rate of HTT reported for this superfamily has been associated with the target-primed reverse transcription mode of transposition of the non-LTR elements, in which the cDNA strand is reverse-transcribed from an RNA template directly onto a chromosomal target site [14], thus not producing extra-chromosomal copies in the stable form of DNA.,The current study aimed to further investigate the rate of HTT in the Jockey superfamily, focusing on the occurrence of its families in drosophilids. For a definition of family, we followed Wicker et al. [15]: a family is a group of highly conserved TEs with a sequence similarity of ≥80% in at least 80% of their coding region in an aligned region of at least 80 nucleotides. The term clade (instead of superfamily) is used by the Repbase database [16], the most commonly used database for TE classification. Repbase also uses a somewhat different criterion from the TE hierarchical classification of Wicker et al. [15], based on studies of enzymology, structural similarities and relationships between sequences [17]. As an example, the 123 Jockey sequences within the Jockey clade are distributed in up to 15 families in each Drosophila species (named Jockey-1 to Jockey-15) in Repbase, and four Jockey families were recorded in D. simulans (Jockey-1_DSim, Jockey-2_DSim, Jockey-3_DSim, and Jockey-4_DSim). Because of the nomenclature criterion used by Repbase, the family Jockey-1_DSim has the same name (Jockey-1) but may not be closely related to the Jockey-1 family of other Drosophila species. Therefore, the criteria for family denomination used by Repbase does not allow identifying the sharing of families between species, either by HT or by VT.,It is important to highlight, as considered by Wicker et al. [15], that “the precise definition of a family is problematic because groups of TEs with similar features sometimes form a continuum of sequence homology; […] it seems that evolutionary lineages are sufficiently distinct to allow the borders of such a continuum to distinguish a family”. Because a family of TEs is a member of an evolutionary lineage, it is essential to consider that its sequences may not be restricted to a single species but shared by a group of species through VT or HTT and to use phylogenetic approaches to identify families. Given the paucity of HTT records for Jockey families in drosophilids (only three cases has been reported so far), one may wonder if the elements of this superfamily are less prone to HTT than elements from other families for which more HTT events have been documented [8]. This study aimed to broaden our understanding of the evolution of Jockey families in drosophilids and to provide an estimate of the rate of HTT involving these families by using phylogenetic approaches. To do so, we sampled 48 genomes of Drosophilidae for the occurrence of Jockey sequences by using the 111 families deposited in Repbase as a query."

They constitute a major source of genetic innovations, as they can not only rearrange genomes but also spread ready-to-use regulatory sequences able to modify host gene expression, and even can give birth to new host genes. As their evolutionary success depends on their vertical transmission, transposable elements are intrinsically linked to reproduction. In organisms with sexual reproduction, this implies that transposable elements have to manifest their transpositional activity in germ cells or their progenitors. The control of sexual development and function can be very versatile, and several studies have demonstrated the implication of transposable elements in the evolution of sex. In this review, we report the functional and evolutionary relationships between transposable elements and sexual reproduction in animals. In particular, we highlight how transposable elements can influence expression of sexual development genes, and how, reciprocally, they are tightly controlled in gonads. We also review how transposable elements contribute to the organization, expression and evolution of sexual development genes and sex chromosomes. This underscores the intricate co-evolution between host functions and transposable elements, which regularly shift from a parasitic to a domesticated status useful to the host.,Transposable elements (TEs) are major actors of the evolution of genomes and the diversification of species [1]. These DNA sequences have the peculiarity of being able to integrate into and spread within genomes, as well as to recombine and induce genome rearrangements, since they are generally repetitive. First discovered in maize [2], TE families described so far are generally divided into two main classes [3]. Class I TEs (retroelements) spread through a “copy-and-paste” mechanism called retrotransposition, which corresponds to a process of RNA-mediated duplication. They express an RNA intermediate that is reverse-transcribed into a cDNA fragment, which will be inserted somewhere else into the genome. Hence, retrotransposition directly increases the copy number of an element. In contrast, Class II TEs (DNA transposons) move through a “cut-and-paste” mechanism. Most autonomous class II elements encode a transposase that can bind to and excise the transposon from its initial genomic localization, and can subsequently insert it into a new locus [3,4,5]. This mechanism does not per se duplicate the initial transposon but only changes its location. However, the transposon can be duplicated if the transposition event occurs during the replication process, from an already replicated region to a non-replicated one.,Since they can insert into genomes, recombine and generate different types of rearrangements, TEs are by nature an important source of genomic variability between different species, or between individuals within a given species or population. Most insertions are thought to be deleterious for the host, in particular when they disrupt essential genes, regulatory regions or chromosomal structures, causing negative effects ranging from a slight decrease in host fitness to lethal mutations [6]. When a TE insertion is associated with such a fitness disadvantage, it is generally counter-selected and finally lost. The process of loss can however be modulated by several factors, including the selection coefficient of the insertion, its potential linkage disequilibrium with an advantageous allele, the recombination rate of the region of insertion, and the effective population size of the host [7]. Some insertions, in contrast, can be neutral, for example if they occur in genomic regions that have no crucial impact on host fitness, like gene-poor regions for instance. It is however difficult to classify an insertion as “neutral” once and for all, since it can still induce chromosomal rearrangements through ectopic recombination [8]. Lastly, some TE insertions might bring positively selected changes. In particular, TEs can spread ready-to-use regulatory sequences or trigger epigenetic modifications able to modify the pattern of expression of neighboring genes (for a review see [9]). TEs can also be “domesticated” as new host non-coding RNA genes or genes encoding useful proteins such as the syncytins, which are involved in the development of the placenta in mammals [10,11,12]. Syncytin genes have been repeatedly derived from envelope genes of endogenous retroviruses during mammalian evolution. Another example of TE-derived host proteins are the Rag proteins, which catalyze the V(D) J recombination responsible for the diversity of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors found in B and T cells, respectively. These proteins were formed from a Transib DNA transposon about 500 million years ago [13]. Many other examples of TE-derived genes have been described in different organisms (for a review see [11, 14]).,Persistence of TEs within a population, which would reflect their evolutionary success, requires their vertical transmission from one generation to the next. In animals with sexual reproduction, i.e. involving the fusion of male and female gametes, this implies transposition in the germline cells that will form the next generation. Sexual reproduction might be instrumental for the propagation of mainly deleterious TEs [15,16,17]. Indeed, in asexual populations, TEs might not be able to spread and tend to be eliminated if no horizontal transfer occurs [15,16,17]. Accordingly, experimental studies have shown that TEs are less fit to increase their frequency in asexual populations compared to sexual populations [15, 17,18,19]. Homologous recombination during meiosis is another feature of sexual reproduction that has an antagonistic impact on the fixation rate of TEs by favoring the elimination of deleterious TE insertions [20, 21]. Recombination triggers the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes belonging to a same chromosome pair. This process has been associated to an increase of purifying selection since it drives the removal of deleterious point mutations and TE insertions [20, 21]. Hence, recombination and sexual reproduction could be considered as a defense mechanism against deleterious TE insertions. Reciprocally, high rates of deleterious mutations such as TE transpositions might favor the maintenance of sexual reproduction as an efficient way to keep these mutations at levels compatible with life [15, 17, 22,23,24]. In the asexual species Leptopilina clavipes (the wasp), no particularly high TE content is observed, despite the expansion of specific TE families, which could be linked to the switch toward asexuality [25]. The absence of recombination here does not seem to have triggered a massive expansion of TEs, or is counterbalanced by the limited spreading of TEs in the population due to asexuality. Similarly, no difference in TE composition was observed between the genome of an asexual fish of hybrid origin, the amazon molly Poecilia formosa, and the genomes of its parental sexual species, possibly due to the very recent occurrence of the switch from sexuality to asexuality in this lineage [26]. In the more ancient asexual taxa of the bdelloid rotifers, retrotransposons were long thought to be absent [27], supporting the role of sexuality in the genomic maintenance of these TEs [23]. More recent studies somehow challenged this model by highlighting a high diversity of TE families including LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons. However, each of these families presents a very low number of intact copies (one or two for the majority of them) [28]. Such a TE landscape, associated with the relatively low abundance of decayed fragments, the high similarity between LTRs for intact copies, and the localization of TEs in horizontally transmitted regions, led the authors to hypothesize that TEs were mostly acquired by recent horizontal transfers in rotifers [28].,In species with gonochoristic sex, i.e. species in which individuals are either male or female (in contrast to hermaphrodite species, in which individuals produce both male and female gametes), different factors can control sex determination (SD) [29, 30]. Some species undergo environmental sex determination (ESD), while others are subject to genetic sex determination (GSD). In ESD sex is determined by environmental factors, for instance temperature in turtles or crocodilians [31, 32]. Such temperature sex determination seems to be also present, albeit rare, in fish, as it was recently demonstrated for the Southern flounder [33]. In GSD on the contrary, the sex of the individual depends on its genotype. Sex can be determined by several interacting loci in a given species (polygenic sex determinism), but the most prevalent situation appears to be the monogenic GSD. In this situation, the chromosome pair that harbors the master SD gene becomes the sex chromosomes, or gonosomes. Two main sex chromosome configurations exist: the XX/XY system, particularly found in mammals, where males have two types of sex chromosomes (X and Y, male heterogamety), and the ZW/ZZ system, common in birds, where females have two different sex chromosomes (Z and W, female heterogamety) [34, 35]. Many other GSD systems have been reported such as haplodiploidy, where for instance males arise from haploid unfertilized eggs and female from diploid fertilized eggs, like in bees, ants, or some molluscs [36]. In the XX/XY sex determination system in mammals, the Sry gene is the male master sex determining gene for almost all species. Sry is located on the Y but not on the X chromosome and is therefore present in males but not in females. Non-mammalian species such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster or the medaka fish Oryzias latipes also have XX/XY sex determination systems but of independent evolutionary origins. The Sry gene is absent from these species. In O. latipes the Y-linked master gene dmrt1bY, which is a Y-specific duplicate of the dmrt1 gene, drives development toward the male phenotype like Sry in mammals [37, 38]. In D. melanogaster, the X chromosome carries Sxl that has to be in two copies to trigger female differentiation [39]. In this case, the initial choice between the male and female pathways is thus triggered by a dosage effect of the master gene. In birds, a similar process occurs but in a ZW/ZZ system, where ZZ males have two copies of the Z-linked dmrt1 gene and females only one. This creates a gene dosage difference, leading to male or female differentiation [40]. In the nematode C. elegans individuals are either males or hermaphrodites. The presence of two X chromosomes (XX individuals) triggers the differentiation into a hermaphrodite adult that produces both male and female gametes. In contrast, XO individuals differentiate into males as a consequence of the ratio between X chromosomes and autosomes [41, 42].,Once sexual development is initiated, the gonad, which comprises both germ cells and somatic cells, differentiates into either a testis or an ovary. A sex-dependent gene regulatory cascade, initiated in the somatic part of the gonad, controls differentiation [30, 43, 44]. Male and female differentiation cascades are often repressing each other, creating a competition between male and female differentiation genes: the most expressed pathway represses the other one [43]. Finally, once the gonad is differentiated, sex is maintained by the expression of specific genes like those encoding the sexual hormone biosynthesis pathways in mammals. It has been shown in mammals and teleost fish that even in adults, de-repressing the opposite pathway can induce sex reversal [45,46,47]. This demonstrates that expression of at least some of the sexual development network genes is necessary to maintain the differentiated state in sexually mature individuals. Beyond gonads, sex affects many other pathways in the organism, creating a bias in gene expression in several tissues and organs including brain [48,49,50,51,52,53]. However, gonads remain the most sex-biased organs in terms of gene expression.,Depending on the animal lineage, sexual development and particularly sex determination can show very different evolutionary dynamics. Some SD systems are ancient and at least 100 million years old, such as the mammalian male heterogamety system driven by the Y-linked gene Sry [54] or the avian female heterogametic determination controlled by the Z-linked dmrt1 gene [40]. In other lineages, for instance in teleost fish, sex determination is much more labile, with a frequent switch between and even combination of ESD and GSD, and an important turn-over of sex chromosomes and master sex-determining genes in GSD [55, 56]. For example, the genetic sex determination system is not conserved in the genus Oryzias: while O. latipes, O. curvinotus, O. luzonensis and O. dancena use a XX/XY system, O. javanicus determines sex through ZW/ZZ female heterogamety [57]. Strikingly, Oryzias species with a XX/XY system generally have different sex chromosomes and even different master sex-determining genes: sex is controlled by dmrt1bY (aka dmy) in O. latipes and O. curvinotus, gsdfY in O. luzonensis and sox3Y in O. dancena [57]. Hence, the control of sexual development can be considered as a fast-evolving trait in this clade. Beyond the initiation of sex differentiation, the downstream molecular pathways also appear variable among animals: a comparison of genes expressed in medaka fish and mammalian gonads revealed substantial differences [58]. Very interestingly, the control of sexual development sometimes experiences convergent evolution: in both therian mammals (non-egg-laying placental mammals and marsupials) and Oryzias dancena for instance, the master sex-determining gene evolved from the Sox3 gene [59]. This happened independently in the two lineages, 148 to 166 million years ago in a common ancestor of therian mammals, and less than 20 million years ago in Oryzias dancena. Another striking example is the dmrt1 gene in birds and in the tongue sole. This gene was ancestrally located on the vertebrate linkage group A, which became the Z chromosome independently in both lineages [60].,In this review, we reassess the impact of transposable elements on the structure and expression of genes and genomes through the prism of sex by inventorying the known reciprocal interactions between TEs and sexual development and function in animals. The species sample, however, appears heavily biased towards insects and vertebrates, since most of the studies linking TE and sex have been conducted in classical model organisms commonly used in genetics and development. We first focus on the expression of TEs in germ cells and on the control of their expression. Then, we review how TEs, reciprocally, can impact the expression of sexual development genes. Finally, we document how TEs influence the organization and structural evolution of sexual genes and chromosomes. These diverse and reciprocal influences well illustrate the intricate co-evolution of TEs with their host."

Here we provide an update on The Transposon Registry which allocates numbers to any prokaryotic transposable element. Additionally, we present the completion of registry records for all transposons assigned Tn numbers from Tn1 onwards where sequence data or publications exist.,A diverse array of transposable elements (TEs) can be found in the genomes of most prokaryotes where their evolutionary strategies for replication and mobility are often inextricably linked with fundamental roles in the evolution and adaptation of their hosts. Defined as “specific DNA segments that can repeatedly insert into one or more sites in one or more genomes” [1] an increasing variety of TEs are being discovered, facilitated by the normalisation of rapid whole genome sequencing and analysis. The opportunity for a researcher to be able to use a number-based, characteristic-free (in terms of the TE genome), nomenclature system to assign a unique name to a new TE means that the sequence of, and associated publications on, the newly described TE will be searchable and the nomenclature system can deal with any manner of genetic variation within TEs and their hosts.,The Transposon Registry is a nomenclature system for the assignment of Tn numbers for bacterial and archaeal autonomous TEs, including unit transposons, composite transposons, conjugative transposons (CTns)/Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs), Mobilisable transposons (MTns)/Integrative mobilisable elements (IMEs) and mobile genomic islands. The online registry is well established and has been utilised extensively over the last decade assigning over 700 Tn numbers to researchers to date. It excludes insertion sequences (ISs), which are managed by ISfinder database (www-is.biotoul.fr) and other TEs such as introns and inteins for which other databases already exist, and non-autonomous TEs such as integron cassettes and MITES. It is also worth noting that alternative nomenclature guidelines have been proposed for the ICEs and IMEs which uses “ICE” or “IME” followed by a two or three letter acronym of the host and a sequential number [2]. There is however cross-over between these two nomenclature systems as the “Tn” part of a newly designated Tn number from The Transposon Registry can be written as “CTn” (for conjugative transposon) or “ICE” or indeed “MTn” or “IME” as preferred [1] which enables researchers to cope with findings from metagenomes where host identification may not be possible. In this short review we provide a historical perspective, thoughts on future directions for TE annotation and nomenclature and an update on The Transposon Registry."

However, the extent of variation in TE transcript levels across different tissues and different individuals are unknown, and the co-expression between TEs and host gene mRNAs have not been examined.,Here we report the variation in TE derived transcript levels across tissues and between individuals observed in the non-tumorous tissues collected for The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found core TE co-expression modules consisting mainly of transposons, showing correlated expression across broad classes of TEs. Despite this co-expression within tissues, there are individual TE loci that exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, when compared across tissues. The core TE modules were negatively correlated with other gene modules that consisted of immune response genes in interferon signaling. KRAB Zinc Finger Proteins (KZFPs) were over-represented gene members of the TE modules, showing positive correlation across multiple tissues. But we did not find overlap between TE-KZFP pairs that are co-expressed and TE-KZFP pairs that are bound in published ChIP-seq studies.,We find unexpected variation in TE derived transcripts, within and across non-tumorous tissues. We describe a broad view of the RNA state for non-tumorous tissues exhibiting higher level of TE transcripts. Tissues with higher level of TE transcripts have a broad range of TEs co-expressed, with high expression of a large number of KZFPs, and lower RNA levels of immune genes.,Although transposable elements (TEs) have been studied for a long time, their ubiquitous and highly tissue-specific expression patterns are starting to be appreciated only recently. The fact that TEs compose close to 40% of the human genome is frequently emphasized, but the fact that there is observable amount of TE derived transcripts in human RNA-seq data has mostly been ignored or regarded as a nuisance without any functional relevance [1]. Transposable elements have long been thought to be restricted in healthy somatic tissue and expressed only in the germline cells or placental or embryonic development [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. But, both full-length and partial transcripts of transposons are frequently found in the somatic cells [4, 9,10,11] with large variation in expression levels across tissue types, and among different individuals [11, 12]. The level of TE expression is especially pronounced in cancer cells [13,14,15,16], and cell lines [17], but are also observed in neurogenesis [18] and normal somatic tissue. Faulkner et al. in 2009, was the first study to provide a global picture of the significant contribution of retrotransposons to human transcriptome in multiple tissue types [19]. This report showed that 6–30% of transcripts had transcription start sites located within transposons, and these transposons were expressed in a tissue-specific manner and influenced the transcription of nearby genes. The results were extended by Djebali et al. in 2012 showing again the tissue-specificity of transposon expression, and that most of these transcripts are found in the nuclear part of the cell [20]. Given that the majority of the transposons transcribed and measured by Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE) were not initiated at the canonical promoter in the 5′ of the transposon, and that they were enriched in the nuclear compartments, they likely do not reflect the autonomous transcription of active transposable elements that transport to the cytosol for retrotransposition. Whether these TE derived transcripts have functional relevance need further studies. But, in addition to the tissue-specific expression of TEs, important regulatory roles for TEs are emerging (reviewed in [21]). Observations include contribution to transcription start sites [19], source of transcription factor binding sites [22], source of long non-coding RNAs [23], active transcription during early development [24], and even critical function similar to long non-coding RNAs that guide chromatin-remodeling complexes to specific loci in the genome [25].,Although there are many reports of TE expression in the somatic cells, there is still a large gap in our understanding of how TE expression is repressed and de-repressed in human somatic cells. Based on what we have learned so far, TE expression is regulated through multiple layers, consisting of transcription factors, epigenetic modification, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), RNA interference (RNAi), and posttranscriptional host factors. Recently, two different approaches of genome-wide screening have identified proteins that regulate different aspects of the activities of LINE elements, although not necessarily regulation of transcription. CRISPR–Cas9 screen was used to identify proteins that restrict LINE activity [26]. The protein MORC2 and the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex was shown to selectively bind evolutionarily young, full-length LINEs located within euchromatic environments, and promote deposition of histone H3 Lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) for transcriptional silencing [26]. And through proteomics approaches, two studies have recently identified the localization of ORF1 and ORF2 proteins and its interacting partners [27], and the timing of the entrance of the ORF2 protein complex into the nucleus [28]. But, these studies addressed the downstream mechanism of retrotransposition, and no study has yet examined the correlation in transcript levels of transposon RNA and host mRNA.,Recently, high-throughput RNA-seq data of various types of cancer samples and their normal counterparts have become available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [29,30,31]. By focusing on the non-tumorous tissue samples from TCGA, we can access thousands of natural experiments across various types of tissues that show variation in TE transcript levels, and obtain a global picture of TE expression and regulation in humans. An important strength of the TCGA dataset is the large number of samples collected for each tissue type and the high depth of the RNA-seq experiment, with a median of about 150 M reads per sample, which is several times larger than a usual RNA-seq library. The variation in TE transcript levels observed in multiple samples within each tissue, allowed us to analyze the co-expression patterns between host genes and TEs for the first time. We hypothesized that genes that regulate the transcription level of TEs would show correlation in expression levels with the TE transcripts. Since the samples are collected from fresh-frozen tissues, TE transcript levels are observed in vivo, complementing the studies that focus on retrotransposition assays or transposon expression in human cell lines.,We first summarize the survey of TE expression variation found in the RNA-seq data from 697 samples of cancer-adjacent non-tumorous tissue. We confirm the earlier findings that TE expression varies across tissue types. Transcript levels of individual TE loci are highly tissue specific and within each family only a few individual loci are highly expressed, contributing to the bulk of the transposon transcripts at the family level. We also find large variation in total TE transcript level across individual samples within each tissue type.,Although, transposons have strong tissue-specific patterns at the locus level, we also found that the majority of TEs show global co-expression at the family level across samples. By analyzing the co-expression between these TEs and individual genes, we found co-expression modules of TEs and genes replicated across tissues."

Previous studies indicated that this phenotype is caused by ectopic expression in skin of CYP19A1 encoding aromatase that converts androgens to estrogen and thereby inhibits the development of male-specific plumage. A long terminal repeat (LTR) from an uncharacterized endogenous retrovirus (ERV) insertion was found in an isoform of the CYP19A1 transcript from henny feathering chicken. However, the complete sequence and the genomic position of the insertion were not determined.,We used publicly available whole genome sequence data to determine the flanking sequences of the ERV, and then PCR amplified the entire insertion and sequenced it using Nanopore long reads and Sanger sequencing. The 7524 bp insertion contains an intact endogenous retrovirus that was not found in chickens representing 31 different breeds not showing henny feathering or in samples of the ancestral red junglefowl. The sequence shows over 99% sequence identity to the avian leukosis virus ev-1 and ev-21 strains, suggesting a recent integration. The ERV 3’LTR, containing a powerful transcriptional enhancer and core promoter with TATA box together with binding sites for EFIII and Ig/EBP inside the CYP19A1 5′ untranslated region, was detected partially in an aromatase transcript, which present a plausible explanation for ectopic expression of aromatase in non-ovarian tissues underlying the henny feathering phenotype.,We demonstrate that the henny feathering allele harbors an insertion of an intact avian leukosis virus at the 5’end of CYP19A1. The presence of this ERV showed complete concordance with the henny feathering phenotype both within a pedigree segregating for this phenotype and across breeds.,Plumage color is a striking and variable aspect of sexual dimorphism in avian species. Males often exhibit a showy plumage during mating season, which is an example of a compromise between sexual selection and avoiding predation by camouflage color outside the breeding season [1, 2]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of male feathering therefore involves basic principles in developmental and evolutionary biology. The wild ancestor of the domestic chicken, the red junglefowl, shows a spectacular sexual dimorphism like many other pheasant species. However, some domestic chickens carry the dominant henny feathering allele that makes the plumage of males resemble females [3]. This phenotype offers a model to study the molecular basis for sexual dimorphism in avian species and has therefore been extensively studied [4]. The henny feathering trait was first observed by Sir John Sebright in 1800 [5], and became a distinguishing feature of the Sebright Bantam breed (Fig. 1). Other henny feathered chicken breeds such as the Golden Campine likely received this trait from Sebright due to interbreeding by chicken fanciers [6]. The henny feathering (Hf) mutation is desirable when breeding fancy chickens because it allows males to show intrafeather patterns which are normally interrupted in males homozygous for the wild-type allele (hf+). In many other show chicken breeds, only females can meet the criteria for exhibition because of their uniformity of intrafeather patterns. However, in Sebright and Golden Campine, males are preferred because Hf allows them to express uniform intrafeather patterning while retaining other male characters, like larger combs and elongated tail feathers [7].
,Adult male silver Sebright Bantam chicken expressing the henny feathering phenotype. (Photo: Jingyi Li),The plumage in hf+ male chickens has a shiny appearance with pointy tips in saddle and hackle feathers. Hens have a more ‘dun’ plumage with duller, rounder feathers. Testis removal does not affect the appearance of these feathers, however ovary removal in females induces a male-shiny phenotype [8]. The typical feathering of hens is produced by the action of estrogen, predominantly produced in the ovaries through aromatase conversion from androgens [9]. In early studies of the henny feathering phenotype, castration of gonads [10, 11], castration followed by treatment with different androgens [12, 13], as well as transplantation of gonads [14] and skin [15] suggested that the changes induced by Hf must reside in the skin, decreasing testosterone and increasing estrogen, resulting in a feminized plumage [13]. This is consistent with current knowledge that Hf is caused by ectopic expression of aromatase in the skin of Sebright and Campine chickens [4, 16,17,18,19,20,21]. In adult wild-type chickens, aromatase is detectable only in ovaries and hypothalamus [17]. In males carrying the dominant Hf allele, such conversion also happens in non-ovarian tissues such as skin [4]. Hf is co-dominant with respect to aromatase activity, as heterozygotes have an enzyme activity intermediate between the two homozygotes. It is dominant with respect to feathering, as a single dose of the Hf allele leads to the production of adequate estrogen in skin to induce henny feathering [18]. Furthermore, a study on transgenic cocks overexpressing aromatase also resulted in female feathering resembling the Hf phenotype [22]. In other studies, after the injection of an aromatase inhibitor during embryonic stage, female chickens developed testes and had the behavior and physical appearance of males [9, 23].,A long terminal repeat (LTR) from an uncharacterized inherited endogenous retrovirus (ERV) was found in the cDNA of CYP19A1, which encodes aromatase in chicken. This LTR was hypothesized to act as a promoter inducing ubiquitous upregulation of CYP19A1 and thus inducing aromatase activity in non-ovarian tissues [21]. However, the ERV was not characterized in detail, and the mechanism causing ectopic aromatase expression is not fully understood. Here we used publicly available whole genome sequence (WGS) data from chickens with and without henny feathering to identify the flanking sequence of the insertion, and long-read Nanopore as well as Sanger sequencing to characterize the locus. We show that the insertion is indeed an intact 7524 bp recently integrated ERV, which is related to avian leukosis viruses and missing in the ancestral red junglefowl as well as in related chicken breeds."

Previous analyses revealed that TE-mediated gene amplifications can have variable effects on fungal genomes, from inactivation of function to production of multiple active copies. For example, a DNA methyltransferase gene in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (synonym Mycosphaerella graminicola) was amplified to tens of copies, all of which were inactivated by Repeat-Induced Point mutation (RIP) including the original, resulting in loss of cytosine methylation. In another wheat pathogen, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, a histone H3 gene was amplified to tens of copies with little evidence of RIP, leading to many potentially active copies. To further test the effects of transposon-aided gene amplifications on genome evolution and architecture, the repetitive fraction of the significantly expanded genome of the banana pathogen, Pseudocercospora fijiensis, was analyzed in greater detail.,These analyses identified a housekeeping gene, histone H3, which was captured and amplified to hundreds of copies by a hAT DNA transposon, all of which were inactivated by RIP, except for the original. In P. fijiensis the original H3 gene probably was not protected from RIP, but most likely was maintained intact due to strong purifying selection. Comparative analyses revealed that a similar event occurred in five additional genomes representing the fungal genera Cercospora, Pseudocercospora and Sphaerulina.,These results indicate that the interplay of TEs and RIP can result in different and unpredictable fates of amplified genes, with variable effects on gene and genome evolution.,Transposable elements (TEs) or mobile genetic elements are nucleic acid entities that can move in a genome. TEs have been detected in the genomes of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [1], and have been rightly labeled as ‘drivers of genome evolution’ [2] due to their direct and indirect impacts on genes and genomes. Several lines of evidence point to their pivotal role in important processes across the tree of life. For example, Alu elements, at more than a million copies comprising 11% of the human genome, are a major contributor to primate genome evolution and the standing genetic diversity in human populations [3]. Some major effects of Alu-element amplifications include alterations of gene expression from insertions near gene promotors, insertional mutagenesis and repeat-mediated non-homologous recombination that can lead to disease, and ‘exonization’ of Alu elements yielding alternative splicing of transcripts. All of these likely have played an important role in the evolution of humans and other primates [3].,TEs are major contributors to genetic diversity in populations and have been linked to major phenotypic changes in plant morphology. Natural and artificial selection can act on this variation to favor new morphotypes. For example, the transition in plant architecture from highly branched teosinte, the ancestor of modern corn, to apically dominant corn is controlled in part by a quantitative trait locus (QTL), tb1 [4], whose expression is modulated by Hopscotch, a retrotransposon enhancer located 65 kb upstream of the gene [5]. This change in morphology predates the start of agriculture (10,000 years ago) and provided early agriculturalists with existing variation that could be selected from within populations. Similarly, a change in tomato fruit shape from round to elongate was initiated by a retrotransposon-mediated gene duplication of the SUN locus. This rearrangement introduced new upstream cis elements, which increased the expression of SUN, thereby causing the change in morphology [6].,In fungal and oomycete plant pathogens, besides modulating genome size (e.g., Blumeria graminis [7], Pseudocercospora fijiensis; [8]) and genome architecture (Leptosphaeria maculans; [9]), TEs also can be associated with plant-pathogen interactions through modulation of effectors and secondary metabolite gene clusters. TE-rich genomic islands in expanded fungal (P. fijiensis, L. maculans) and oomycete (Phytophthora infestans) genomes carry genes that code for lineage-specific, putative small, secreted proteins. In the barley powdery mildew pathogen, B. graminis f. sp. hordei, the amplification and diversification of an avirulence gene, AVRk1 has been attributed to a Long Interspersed Nuclear Element (LINE) TE [10]. Recently, it was shown that the sequence for this gene family of avirulence effectors was derived from the LINE TE [11]. Other fungal genome components, such as telomeres in the rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae AVR-Pita [12] and lineage-specific chromosomes in Fusarium oxysporum [13] also are enriched in pathogenicity factors and TEs. Recently, TEs have been shown to be implicated in gain and/or loss of host-specific effector genes in M. oryzae [14].,Universal mechanisms exist that can minimize the deleterious impacts of TEs on host genomes. Post-transcriptional silencing and DNA methylation are two primary methods that limit the activity of TEs in genomes. The genetic network employed to silence the TEs also can be context dependent. In germline cells, piRNA, a specific class of small, non-coding RNA, is responsible for the epigenetic and post-transcriptional silencing of TEs [15]. Other genome-defense mechanisms are unique to specific organisms, e.g., Repeat-Induced Point mutation or RIP [16] has been described only in fungi. The RIP machinery can recognize repetitive sequences that are approximately 400 bp or longer with identity of 80% or more, and introduce random transition (cytosine to thymine) mutations during each meiotic cycle in Neurospora crassa [17,18,19] and many other fungi. These mutations generate premature stop codons within TE-encoded genes that prevent translation of the proteins required for movement, thus rendering the transposon immobile. This abundance of transition mutations also skews the GC content of the sequence and makes it possible to identify signatures of RIP [20], as well as to predict the original sequence prior to RIP (deRIP) [21] in silico.,A side effect of RIP is that the required machinery does not discriminate between functional genes and TEs; any sequence in a genome that is repetitive can be targeted, which occasionally causes unexpected effects. For example, a single-copy DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) gene in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (previously known as Mycosphaerella graminicola) was amplified to 23 copies and became a target for RIP. All of the DNMT sequences in the genome, including the original copy, were inactivated by RIP-introduced transition mutations [22]. A genome-wide assay for cytosine methylation revealed that it was lacking in the Z. tritici genome [22], but present in close relatives that possessed an intact copy of the DNMT gene. Those species are thought to have diverged from Z. tritici within the past 10,000 years [23], hence this change appears to be very recent. In another wheat pathogen, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), the histone H3 gene was captured as part of a hAT DNA transposon and amplified to 26 copies in the genome [24]. Acquisition of a partial or complete copy of a gene between the termini of a DNA transposon and its subsequent amplification in a genome is termed ‘transduplication’. However, in contrast to Z. tritici, 23 of the transduplicated histone H3 copies in the Ptr genome appeared to code for a functional protein [24], potentially yielding multiple active copies of the gene. These two fungi are in different taxonomic orders of the class Dothideomycetes, and demonstrate that the fates of repeated sequences can vary, with different and unpredictable effects on gene and genome evolution.,The two examples described above define the extremes of the possible outcomes of TE-mediated gene amplification events in fungi with RIP, where either all the copies, including the original, can be inactivated leading to loss of gene function, or almost none of the copies being affected by RIP leading to multiple functional genes. To test whether similar gene amplifications are common in the Dothideomycetes, a genome-wide search was conducted in multiple sequenced species to quantify the prevalence of such events, and to investigate whether TE-associated gene amplifications occur commonly with large effects on gene and genome evolution. These analyses identified an amplification event in a fungal clade (Cercospora / Pseudocercospora / Sphaerulina) that fits between the spectrum of events bounded by the two extremes described above. In this newly described amplification event, the original gene was maintained, presumably due to selection, whereas all the amplified copies were targeted and inactivated by RIP, thus yielding very different outcomes from three similar gene amplifications in fungi."

                            A considerable portion of the human genome derives from retroviruses inherited over millions of years. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are usually severely mutated, yet some coding-competent HERVs exist....
                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0178-z,HERV-KEndogenous retrovirusRetroviral proteaseProteolysisPathogenesisRetrotransposon,"A considerable portion of the human genome derives from retroviruses inherited over millions of years. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are usually severely mutated, yet some coding-competent HERVs exist. The HERV-K(HML-2) group includes evolutionarily young proviruses that encode typical retroviral proteins. HERV-K(HML-2) has been implicated in various human diseases because transcription is often upregulated and some of its encoded proteins are known to affect cell biology. HERV-K(HML-2) Protease (Pro) has received little attention so far, although it is expressed in some disease contexts and other retroviral proteases are known to process cellular proteins.,We set out to identify human cellular proteins that are substrates of HERV-K(HML-2) Pro employing a modified Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) procedure. Thousands of human proteins were identified by this assay as significantly processed by HERV-K(HML-2) Pro at both acidic and neutral pH. We confirmed cleavage of a majority of selected human proteins in vitro and in co-expression experiments in vivo. Sizes of processing products observed for some of the tested proteins coincided with product sizes predicted by TAILS. Processed proteins locate to various cellular compartments and participate in diverse, often disease-relevant cellular processes. A limited number of HERV-K(HML-2) reference and non-reference loci appears capable of encoding active Pro.,Our findings from an approach combining TAILS with experimental verification of candidate proteins in vitro and in cultured cells suggest that hundreds of cellular proteins are potential substrates of HERV-K(HML-2) Pro. It is therefore conceivable that even low-level expression of HERV-K(HML-2) Pro affects levels of a diverse array of proteins and thus has a functional impact on cell biology and possible relevance for human diseases. Further studies are indicated to elucidate effects of HERV-K(HML-2) Pro expression regarding human substrate proteins, cell biology, and disease. The latter also calls for studies on expression of specific HERV-K(HML-2) loci capable of encoding active Pro. Endogenous retrovirus-encoded Pro activity may also be relevant for disease development in species other than human.,Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), originating from past infections by exogenous retroviruses, and derived elements with some retroviral features, comprise about 8% of the human genome. HERVs affect the biology of the human genome in various ways, ranging from influences on transcription and splicing to biological effects of retrovirus-like proteins still encoded by some HERV groups. For instance, the envelope glycoprotein encoded by a provirus of the so-called HERV-W group was coopted to form the ERVW-1 (Syncytin-1) gene, whose protein product exerts important functions in human placenta development and functionality [1]. The HERV-K(HML-2) group, in short HML-2, includes a number of evolutionarily young proviruses, several of which are human-specific or even polymorphic in the human population [2]. Transcription of some HML-2 loci is upregulated in various human diseases with potential consequences due to the interaction of HML-2-encoded proteins with other cellular proteins (for reviews, see [3,4,5]). For instance, certain types of testicular and ovarian germ cell tumors (GCTs), as well as melanoma and mammary carcinomas, display upregulated HML-2 transcription (reviewed in [6, 7]). Upregulated HML-2 transcription could be observed in lesions considered precursors of testicular GCTs, so-called carcinoma in situ of the testis [8]. GCT patients suffering from GCT-types with HML-2 upregulation already show a strong humoral response against HML-2-encoded Gag and Env proteins at the time of tumor detection [9, 10]. HML-2 encoded Env protein was recently shown to induce several transcription factors and to activate the cellular transformation-associated MAPK ERK1/2 pathway [11]. HML-2 Rec and Np9 proteins, encoded by spliced transcripts from the HML-2 env gene, were shown to interact with several human proteins, among them promyelocytic zinc finger protein (PLZF), testicular zinc finger protein (TZFP), Staufen-1, human small glutamine-rich (hSGT), and ligand of Numb protein X (LNX). Rec expression disturbed germ cell development in mice and altered testis histology towards a carcinoma-like phenotype [12,13,14,15,16,17,18].,Retroviral genomes usually encode several catalytic proteins, among them aspartyl Protease (Pro). HML-2 also encodes Pro that, after self-processing from a Gag-Pro(−Pol) precursor translated through ribosomal frameshifts, cleaves retroviral HML-2 Gag protein into matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid domains, as is typical for other retroviral aspartyl proteases [19,20,21]. There is strong evidence that active HML-2 Pro is expressed at significant amounts and during longer periods of time, especially for GCT. HML-2-encoded retroviral particles budding from GCT cell lines have been detected. Large amounts of HML-2 Gag protein are present in GCT tissue and HML-2 Pro-cleaved Gag protein was demonstrated in GCT cell lines and especially tissue samples [10, 22]. Bieda et al. [23] demonstrated mature HML-2-encoded retroviral particles budding from different GCT cell lines, immature non-budding retroviral particles, as well as cleaved Gag protein in those cell lines. Prokaryotic expression of a construct harboring HML-2 Gag-Pro ORFs results in self-processing of Pro from a Gag-Pro precursor [24], thus Pro is capable of self-processing independent of retroviral particle formation and budding.,Besides retroviral Gag protein, retroviral aspartyl proteases were found to cleave host cellular proteins. HIV Pro processes human Actin, Troponin C, Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein, and Pro-interleukin 1β in vivo. Purified HIV Pro processes Vimentin, Desmosin, and Glial fibrillary acidic protein, and Microtuble-associated proteins 1 and 2 in vitro (reviewed in [25]). Riviere et al. [26] reported processing of the precursor of NF-kappa B by HIV-1 Pro during acute infection. Processing of Vimentin by proteases of Bovine Leukemia Virus, Mason–Pfizer Monkey Virus, and Myeloblastosis-Associated Virus was reported by Snásel et al. [27]. Shoeman et al. [28] reported cleavage of focal adhesion plaque proteins, including Fimbrin, Focal adhesion plaque kinase, Talin, Filamin, Spectrin and Fibronectin by HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. Devroe at al. [29] reported processing of human NDR1 and NDR2 serine-threonine kinases by HIV-1 Pro. More recently, more than 120 cellular substrates were reported to be processed by HIV-1 Pro in vitro by Impens et al. [30]. Thus, aspartyl proteases from diverse retroviruses appear able to degrade quite a number of host cellular proteins. Furthermore, such processing of cellular proteins by retroviral Pro can occur independent of retroviral budding. For instance, cleavage of procaspase 8 by HIV-1 Pro was observed during HIV-1 infection of T-cells and other cell types [31, 32]. HIV-1 Pro was reported to cleave serine-threonine kinases RIPK1 and RIPK2 during HIV-1 infection of T-cell lines or primary activated CD4+ T cells ([33], see references therein for additional examples). A significant amount of processing of HIV-1 Gag occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells resulting in intracellular accumulation of appropriately processed HIV-1 Gag proteins [34]. For Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV), a betaretrovirus closely related with HERV-K(HML-2), activation of Pro can occur before budding, and MMTV Gag protein is primarily found in the cytoplasm and traffics to intracellular membranes to initiate particle assembly. Similar observations were made for Human Foamy Virus [35,36,37]. Thus, retroviral Pro proteins are activated not only during maturation of retroviral particles.,There is evidence that such processing of cellular proteins by retroviral Pro is of biological relevance. Strack et al. [38] reported that apoptosis of HIV-infected cells was preceded by HIV Pro-mediated cleavage of Bcl-2. Cleavage of Procaspase 8 by HIV Pro in T-cells was followed by cellular events characteristic of apoptosis [31]. HIV Pro inducibly expressed in yeast caused cell lysis due to alterations in membrane permeability. Cell killing and lysis, specifically lysis by necrosis without signs of apoptosis, was observed in COS-7 cells following expression of HIV Pro [39]. Cleavage of EIF4G by several retroviral proteases profoundly inhibited cap-dependent translation [40]. Specific inhibition of HIV Pro reduced the extent of both necrosis and apoptosis in C8166 cells [41]. It was recently proposed that cleavage of RIPK1 by HIV-1 Pro might be one of several mechanisms by which HIV-1 counteracts host innate immune responses [33].,There is thus good evidence for cellular effects following expression of retroviral Protease. Although retroviral Protease is encoded in the human genome by HERV-K(HML-2) and expressed in the disease context, there is surprisingly little information as to potential functional relevance of HML-2 Pro expression. We therefore set out to identify human proteins processed by HML-2 Pro by employing specialized proteomics methods. Numerous human proteins were identified as substrates of HML-2 Pro. We further verified processing by HML-2 Pro for selected proteins in vitro and in vivo. Human proteins identified often exert various, often important cellular functions, and many of them are disease-relevant. The relevance of our findings for human disease is currently unknown, yet the sheer number of potentially disease-relevant proteins identified in our study as potential substrates of HML-2 Pro strongly argues for further specific analyses."

Houz) genome possessing transposases that harbour nuclear export signal (NES) domain, but not any nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain. To understand the functions of NES in transposon activity, we have conducted two experiments, fluorescence and excision frequency assays in the yeast system. For this, by site-directed mutagenesis, three NES mutants were developed from each of the MLE. In the fluorescence assay, the mutants, NES-1, 2 and 3 along with the wild types (NES-0) were fused with fluorescent proteins, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) were co-transformed into yeast system. To differentiate protein localisation under the NES influence, ECFP alone was fused to wild and mutant NES domains either on N- or C-terminal and not to EYFP. Fluorescence assay revealed that blue fluorescence of ECFP was more intense than the red fluorescence of the EYFP in the yeast cell matrix. Further, ECFP had a wider localisation in the cellular matrix, but EYFP was largely located in the nucleus. The NES-1 domain was related to the comparatively high spread of ECFP, while NES-2 and NES-3 indicated a low spread, implying that NES activity on nuclear export increased when the NES is made leucine-rich, while the signalling activity was reduced when the leucine content was lowered in the NES domain. In the transposon excision assay, the mutant and wild type NES of both the Ppmar elements were integrated into an Ade2 vector, and within the Ade2 gene. Co-transformation of the vector together with non-autonomous Ppmar transposons and NES-lacking transposases was used to assess the differential excision frequencies of the mutants NES domains. In both the MLEs, NES-1 had the highest excision suppression, which was less than half of the excision frequency of the wild type. NES-2 and NES-3 elements showed, up to three times increase in transposon excision than the wild types. The results suggested that NES is an important regulator of nuclear export of transposase in Ppmar elements and the mutation of the NES domains can either increase or decrease the export signalling. We speculate that in moso bamboo, NESs regulates the transposition activity of MLEs to maintain the genome integrity.,Transposable elements (TEs), or ‘jumping genes’ or transposons, are DNA sequences that have the ability to move within the genome [1]. Transposons are ubiquitous in plant and animal genomes in abundance. There are two distinctive types, (a) DNA transposons (class II) that transpose by a DNA-mediated “cut-paste” mechanism [2] and (b) retrotransposons (class I) that act through the “copy-paste” mechanism involving an RNA intermediate [3]. There are several variants within each of the two types. One of the most prevalent DNA transposon families in eukaryotic genomes is the Tc1/mariner superfamily, which plays a significant role in genome evolution [4,5,6]. Because of its near-identical sequence similarity to the bacterial insertion sequence, IS630 [7], Tc1/mariner superfamily is expanded to include IS630 elements and is renamed as ITm (IS630-Tc1-mariner) superfamily. ITm transposons are characterized by self-driven mobility of its members and are generally independent of host factors to mediate transposition. In nature, they show a widespread distribution, frequent and total random insertions, and have a high frequency of heterologous transposition [8, 9]. Because of their versatile nature, they are used in genetic studies, as a tool in gene tagging, transgenesis and insertional mutagenesis [8, 9]. ITm transposons are further classified [10], among which three major families are, Tc1-like elements (TLEs) [11], mariner-like elements (MLEs) [12] and Pogo-like elements [13]. Among the MLEs, two important members, mosaic element 1 (Mos1) and Haematobia irritans mariner 1 (Himar1) [14] are widely studied for their cross genome transportability and used as tools in genetic studies. These hyperactive elements are found to increase their transposition activities when expressed in different host genomes such as bacteria by 200–800 [15] times, and by 10–50 times when mutated [16].,MLEs have a relatively simple structure, consisting mainly of terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and an open reading frame (ORF) [17]. Their TIRs are generally 10–40 bp long and contain protein-binding elements. ORF is 1000–1500 bp long and encodes for the transposase (TPase) gene. TPases are enzymes responsible for transposition activity. Structurally, they contain a DNA binding domain and a catalytic domain [17]. Additionally, the TPase contains one or more short sequences of nuclear localization signals (NLS) [18] and nuclear export signals (NES) [19]. NES also is a short (8–15 residues) amino acid sequence consisting usually of four to five hydrophobic residues in a protein [20]. It is often leucine-rich [21]. Figuratively, TPase expression includes nuclear transcription and processing, mRNA export to the cytoplasm, protein synthesis, and protein folding and import back into the nucleus for mediating the transposition activity. Any change in these steps can affect the transposition frequency [22]. While NLS acts for nuclear retention of the TPase molecules, NES mediates export out of the nucleus. Therefore, depending on the cellular stage and physiological state, counterbalancing activities of NLS and NES motifs can influence the transposition activity [16, 23]. Hancock et al. [24] found that a mutation of the NES domain in the TPase of mPing, a deletion derivative of autonomous rice PIF/Harbinger transposon Ping, increased transposition activity in both yeast and plants. Similarly, Fattash et al. [19] identified that a mutation of a putative NES in the Ozma TPase dramatically increased transposition of the Eif and Goblin MITEs in yeast.,In our previous study, we reported an abundance of MLEs in various bamboo genomes belonging to 38 genera of the Bambusoideae family [25]. Consequently, two full-length MLE transposons, named Ppmar1 and Ppmar2, were cloned from moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis (Carrière) J. Houz) genome [26]. Both of these transposons were demonstrated to transpose in yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana genome and exhibited their affinity towards TA-rich regions. They were also shown to get integrated into nearby genes [27,28,29]. TPases of both, Ppmar1 and Ppmar2 harbour NES domains, but it is still uncertain whether and how the NESs affects their transposition. In order to examine this, we used site-directed mutagenesis to mutate NES sequences of Ppmar1 and Ppmar2 in moso bamboo. The influence of the mutated NES domains on the localization of TPase in the cell and their transposition frequencies were systematically studied using different NES mutants by the help of a yeast screening system and yeast transposition assay. To the best of our knowledge, no earlier reports are available on the influence of NESs on TPase localization and transposition activity of Ppmar1 and Ppmar2 transposons."

The genomes of these species enclose a fraction of retrotransposons including VIPER and TATE, two poorly studied transposable elements that encode a tyrosine recombinase (YR) and were previously classified as DIRS elements. This study investigated the distribution and evolution of VIPER and TATE in kinetoplastids to understand the relationships of these elements with other retrotransposons.,We observed that VIPER and TATE have a discontinuous distribution among Trypanosomatidae, with several events of loss and degeneration occurring during a vertical transfer evolution. We were able to identify the terminal repeats of these elements for the first time, and we showed that these elements are potentially active in some species, including T. cruzi copies of VIPER. We found that VIPER and TATE are strictly related elements, which were named in this study as VIPER-like. The reverse transcriptase (RT) tree presented a low resolution, and the origin and relationships among YR groups remain uncertain. Conversely, for RH, VIPER-like grouped with Hepadnavirus, whereas for YR, VIPER-like sequences constituted two different clades that are closely allied to Crypton. Distinct topologies among RT, RH and YR trees suggest ancient rearrangements/exchanges in domains and a modular pattern of evolution with putative independent origins for each ORF.,Due to the presence of both elements in Bodo saltans, a nontrypanosomatid species, we suggested that VIPER and TATE have survived and remained active for more than 400 million years or were reactivated during the evolution of the host species. We did not find clear evidence of independent origins of VIPER-like from the other YR retroelements, supporting the maintenance of the DIRS group of retrotransposons. Nevertheless, according to phylogenetic findings and sequence structure obtained by this study and other works, we proposed separating DIRS elements into four subgroups: DIRS-like, PAT-like, Ngaro-like, and VIPER-like.,Trypanosomatid species are among the most ancient eukaryotes, comprising more than ten genera that include both monoxenous insect parasites and dixenous species, which alternate between insects and vertebrates (or plants) [1,2,3]. Species of Trypanosoma and Leishmania cause some human pathologies, such as Chagas disease (T. cruzi), sleeping sickness (T. brucei) and leishmaniasis (genus Leishmania) and are transmitted by invertebrate vectors [4]. In addition to the importance of these species as pathogens, they have several unique features. The protein-coding genes of trypanosomatids are transcribed polycistronically, and the mature monocistronic mRNAs are generated by a trans-splicing mechanism and polyadenylation [5]. Moreover, gene expression in these species is mostly regulated posttranscriptionally, since all polycistronic precursor RNAs seem to be transcribed at approximately the same rate [6].,More than 10 years ago, the reference genome sequences of three trypanosomatids, T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major, were published [7,8,9]. These genomes are highly repetitive (over 50% in T. cruzi), mainly due to large gene families of surface molecules, subtelomeric repeats and transposable elements (TEs) (exclusively retrotransposons) [8]. Recently, Pita et al. (2019) compared the repetitive DNA portions among these three genomes using genome-wide, low-coverage Illumina sequencing. These authors estimated that the genome fraction corresponding to retrotransposons ranges from 12.6% in T. cruzi to 5.7% in T. brucei and only 1.6% in L. major [10].,Retrotransposons are eukaryotic mobile elements that move through an RNA intermediate. They constitute an important source of genetic variation and have actively shaped the structure, function, and evolution of genomes [11,12,13,14]. Although considerable attention has been devoted to the two major groups of retrotransposons (LTR and non-LTR elements [15, 16]), recent results have confirmed the presence of another ubiquitous group of retroelements [17,18,19,20,21] that encode a tyrosine recombinase (YR) gene instead of integrase (IN) or endonuclease (EN). Wicker et al. (2007) classified the YR-containing retroelements in the order DIRS, named based on the first described YR retrotransposon, the DIRS1 from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum [22].,YR elements, in general, contain three long ORFs (open reading frames). ORF1 was considered a putative gag-like gene, given the similarities in size and position with the upstream region of LTR retrotransposons. These elements also have ORFs encoding a YR and a reverse transcriptase/RNase H (RT/RH) that are frequently extensively overlapped [23]. In some DIRS elements, it is also possible to find a coding region for a methyltransferase (MT) or a hydrolase whose functions are still unknown. These elements present a diversified structure of repeats that can be primarily of two types: (1) terminal inverted repeats (ITRs) and an internal complementary region (ICR) that is complementary to the beginning of the left ITR and to the end of the right ITR or (2) “split” direct repeats [24].,Wicker et al. (2007) divided the DIRS order into three subfamilies, DIRS, Ngaro, and VIPER. Recently, Poulter and Butler (2015) divided the YR retrotransposons into three major subgroups: DIRS, PAT-like, and Ngaro elements. This subdivision was based on a phylogenetic tree of the RT/RH domains and on structural differences, which led to the separation of PAT-like from the DIRS subgroup. VIPER (vestigial interposed retroelement) sequences were not included in the latter analyses. This retroelement was encountered in T. cruzi [25], T. brucei and T. vivax [26] and was considered an extinct retrotransposon due to the absence of potentially functional copies and to the apparent lack of conserved terminal repeat regions [26, 27]. Moreover, there is another element, TATE (telomere associated transposable element), that could be classified as DIRS and was found in the genome of L. braziliensis as in tandem clusters inserted at the same relative position within the telomeric hexamer repeats (GGG↑TTA) [28].,Little is known about VIPER and TATE in trypanosomatids, and several questions about their structure, functioning and origin remain unanswered. In this study, we investigated the distribution of these elements in the available trypanosomatid genomes and provided evidence that some of their copies could still be active in some species. We also performed an evolutionary analysis of retrotransposon RT, RH and YR proteins. Although we failed to fully elucidate the relationships among YR elements, some differences in topologies were recovered for distinct domains, suggesting the occurrence of a modular pattern of evolution with ancient changes in domains. Moreover, our results suggested a close relationship between VIPER-like sequences and the hepadnavirus RH region that may reflect a shared origin of this domain. This paper represents a first step in characterizing the functioning and impact of YR-containing TEs in kinetoplastids.,We used the retrotransposon group nomenclature according to the classification system of Wicker et al. (2007) [29]: order LINE; superfamilies Copia, Gypsy, Bel-Pao, and Retrovirus from order LTR; superfamilies within order DIRS were updated to DIRS-like, PAT-like, Ngaro-like, and VIPER-like. The non-italicized term “DIRS” was used to refer to all the YR-containing retrotransposons (order DIRS)."

Despite high-resolution analyses of the Xist RNA-binding sites, specific interaction sequences are yet to be identified. Based on elusive features of the association between Xist RNA and chromatin and the possible existence of multiple low-affinity binding sites in Xist RNA, we defined short motifs (≥5 nucleotides), termed as redundant UC/TC (r-UC/TC) or AG (r-AG) motifs, which may help in the mediation of triplex formation between the lncRNAs and duplex DNA.,The study showed that r-UC motifs are densely dispersed throughout mouse and human Xist/XIST RNAs, whereas r-AG motifs are even more densely dispersed along opossum RNA-on-the-silent X (Rsx) RNA, and also along both full-length and truncated long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1s, L1s) of the three species. Predicted secondary structures of the lncRNAs showed that the length range of these sequence motifs available for forming triplexes was even shorter, mainly 5- to 9-nucleotides long. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations indicated that minimum-length motifs can reinforce the binding state by increasing the copy number of the motifs in the same RNA or DNA molecule. Further, r-AG motifs in L1s had a similar length-distribution pattern, regardless of the similarities in the length or sequence of L1s across the three species; this also applies to high-frequency mutations in r-AG motifs, which suggests convergence in L1 sequence variations.,Multiple short motifs in both RNA and duplex DNA molecules could be brought together to form triplexes with either Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, by which their associations are cooperatively enhanced. This novel triplex interaction could be involved in associations between lncRNA and chromatin in XCI, particularly at the sites of L1s. Potential binding of Xist/XIST/Rsx RNAs specifically at L1s is most likely preserved through the r-AG motifs conserved in mammalian L1s through convergence in L1 nucleotide variations and by maintaining a particular r-UC/r-AG motif ratio in each of these lncRNAs, irrespective of their poorly conserved sequences.,A 17–19-kb mouse Xist (X-inactive specific transcript)/human XIST long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a pivotal role in a process called X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a mechanism by which mammalian dosage compensation for the X-linked genes occurs between the sexes. In early female embryogenesis, Xist/XIST RNA, expressed from the future inactive X chromosome (Xi), spreads in cis and associates with the Xi, as a result of which gene silencing and a repressive chromatin state are achieved [1,2,3]. Despite the functional similarities between Xist and XIST RNAs, the gene sequences were found to be only 66% similar for exons [4], a finding which is in contrast with the overall 85% identity for 1,880 rodent/human mRNA sequence pairs [5]. A 24-kb Rsx (RNA-on-the-silent X) RNA, a lncRNA involved in marsupial XCI, exhibited no homology with Xist/XIST RNAs, although it showed similar functions, such as association with the entire Xi chromatin and subsequent induction of gene silencing in cis [6]. This enigmatic sequence−function relationship could be linked to elusive features of the Xist/XIST/Rsx RNA−chromatin association, where no specific sequence motifs or factors involved in the interactions have been identified [7, 8].,Intriguingly, in a series of Xist deletion analyses, multiple low-affinity or functionally redundant, but unspecified, sequences were predicted to be dispersed throughout the Xist RNA, by which Xist RNA could cooperatively associate with chromatin [9]. With regard to DNA elements, long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1, L1) repetitive sequences have been proposed as candidate way stations for Xist/XIST RNA spreading on the mouse and human X chromosomes, a concept known as the Lyon repeat hypothesis [10], which is an extension of the Gartler–Riggs model [11]. This hypothesis, albeit still controversial, has been supported by multiple evidences based on cytological and computational studies: (1) increased L1 content in the mouse and human X chromosomes compared to the autosomes [12, 13]; (2) the non-random distribution of L1s on the X chromosome, which is consistent with the locations of the chromatin segments harboring the genes subject to or escaping XCI [12, 14]; (3) a strong positive association between the spreading efficiency of XCI signals and the L1 density, which was observed in X-autosome translocations or in Xist transgene-inducible systems [15,16,17]; and (4) the preferential enrichment of multiple oligomers in L1 elements that could predict the expression status of X-linked genes [18]. Furthermore, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) revealed the possible involvement of both silent (or truncated) and actively expressed L1s in the process of XCI: the former created a repressive nuclear compartment which was initially coated with Xist RNA, while the latter contributed to further local spreading of XCI [19]. On the other hand, high-resolution mapping studies of Xist RNA localization produced results different from those of the works supporting the Lyon repeat hypothesis: Xist RNA did not localize to any specific sequences [20, 21], but to gene-rich regions as early domains, showing a strong negative association with L1 elements, and subsequently to gene-poor regions as late domains, to which Xist RNAs bind only weakly [21]. Although Engreitz et al. [20] revealed that Xist RNA spreading on a 150-Mb scale is mediated by dynamic organization of the three-dimensional architecture of the Xi, both of two key components—spatial proximity and sequence specificity—would be required for proper localization of Xist RNA to specific target sites [20, 22].,L1 elements have been identified in all mammalian species, including both metatherians (marsupial mammals) and eutherians (placental mammals). However, the X chromosome of the marsupial opossum, unlike that in eutherians, does not show L1 enrichment compared to autosomes [14, 23], a finding which is, according to the Lyon repeat hypothesis, consistent with the observation of incomplete XCI in marsupials [24, 25]. Thus, it can be considered that, despite the dissimilarity in both the L1 contents in the X chromosome and the Xist/XIST/Rsx RNA sequences, epigenetic features of the XCI process are conserved across metatherians and eutherians [6, 24, 26].,In recent years, it has been recognized that lncRNAs achieve regulatory diversity and specificity through modular combinations with other biomolecules such as RNA, DNA, proteins, and small molecules [7, 27,28,29]. An example of a protein involved in lncRNA–protein–DNA modules is hnRNPU (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U)/SAF-A (scaffold attachment factor A), which can bind to both Xist RNA and DNA, and is required for Xist RNA localization [30]. Also, the RNA–dsDNA (double-stranded DNA) triplex is another module, which has been thought to serve as a guide for noncoding RNA to sequence-specific DNA targets, with examples such as pRNA (promoter-associated RNA, ~ 90–100 nucleotides) and MEG3 (maternally expressed gene 3) lncRNA having been reported [31, 32]. However, it has been pointed out that no direct evidence of triplex conformation and their functions in living cells has been provided because of the transient and dynamic nature of these structures, and the limitations of current technical capabilities, hence more careful evaluation of experimental results is required [33,34,35,36].,Keeping these points in mind, here we report examples of short-sequence motifs that were designed to fulfill the redundancy in forming triplexes between Xist/XIST/Rsx RNA and duplex DNA, especially the L1 elements on the mouse, human, and opossum X chromosomes. Using bioinformatics, computer simulations, and in vitro analyses of circular dichroism (CD) spectra and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements, we identified characteristic features of the short motifs, which are abundantly localized in both Xist/XIST/Rsx RNAs and L1s of the three species. We also showed convergent patterns of variation in L1 base composition, which results in the conservation of the short motifs in L1s, thereby contributing to the retention of their ability across mammalian species to redundantly form triplexes with the lncRNAs involved in XCI, these occurring through Hoogsteen (the third strand pyrimidine in parallel orientation) or reverse Hoogsteen (the third strand purine in antiparallel orientation) base-pairing (Fig. 1; [37]).,Schematic representation of triple helices.

Each TE copy can be present in hundreds to thousands of locations within the genome, complicating the genetic and genomic studies of these highly repetitive sequences. The recent development of better tools for evaluating TE derived sequences in genomic studies has enabled an increasing appreciation for the contribution of TEs to human development and disease. While some TEs have contributed novel and beneficial host functions, this review will summarize the evidence for detrimental TE activity in neurodegenerative disorders. Much of the evidence for pathogenicity implicates endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), a subset of TEs that entered the genome by retroviral infections of germline cells in our evolutionary ancestors and have since been passed down as a substantial fraction of the human genome. Human specific ERVs (HERVs) represent some of the youngest ERVs in the genome, and thus are presumed to retain greater function and resultant pathogenic potential.,Transposable elements (TEs) represent a vast array of genomic sequences that have (or once had) the ability to mobilize from one location in the genome to another. Several excellent reviews explain the general features and behavior of transposable elements [1,2,3]. Two major classes of TEs exist: Class I TEs, also called retrotransposons, utilize an RNA intermediate that is reverse transcribed before genomic reinsertion; Class II TEs, or DNA transposons, move via excision from one genomic location and insertion into another. In most genomes, Class I retrotransposons represent the vast majority of TE derived sequences since new copies accumulate with each transposition event. Retrotransposons can further be subdivided into a few major families: the long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) class of fully autonomous retroelements (21% of the human genome [4] the SINE class of shorter retroelements that rely on LINE encoded proteins for mobilization (13% [4]), and the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons that include endogenous retroviruses (ERV, 8%) [4]. ERV sequences [1,2,3, 5] represent an interesting subclass of TEs that derive from retroviral infections of germline cells in our ancestors, which were then endogenized and passed along to future generations. Some of the evolutionarily youngest (ie, most recently inserted) TEs are present only in the genomes of humans and closely related primates, and are dubbed human ERVs (HERVs).,While nearly half of the human genome is composed of TE derived sequences [4], almost all of these sequences have lost the ability to mobilize to new locations. Only the human specific LINE-1 (L1) element, L1HS, present in full form in 100–180 locations in the human genome [6,7,8,9], retains the ability to autonomously mobilize and create new insertional mutations. Other TEs have less autonomous levels of function, varying from the simple ability to be transcribed into RNAs, the ability to make functional proteins, the ability to reverse transcribe their RNA transcripts into cDNA, and, finally, the ability to attempt genomic insertion. Thus, while many studies of TEs focus on detection of new transposition events (hopping), their novel functional activities can be broadly classified based on whether they engender RNA expression, cDNA generation, and/or production of functional proteins. Each TE insertion encodes for a different level of activity due to mutations within the TE sequence that may render protein or regulatory sequences non-functional. Thus it is important to be specific about the relative ability for each TE copy to affect cellular function, following the detection of aberrant TE accumulation.,The most commonly implicated pathogenic functions of TEs result from direct mutagenic effects of newly transposed insertions. As stated above, only a subset of L1HS elements are fully capable of mobilizing in vivo, creating de novo insertional mutations at a rate of about one L1HS germline insertion per 100 individuals [10]. In addition, L1HS machinery can facilitate mobilization of other non-autonomous TE families, including Alu and SVA (SINE/VNTR/Alu), some of which are known to be polymorphic (representing relatively recent insertion events) with estimated transposition rates of about 0.04 and 0.001 new insertions per generation, respectively [10], and an overall retrotransposition rate of about 0.02 germline events per generation. L1HS can also mobilize in certain somatic tissues, with a transposition rate estimated at about 0.04–13 insertions per cell in neurons [11,12,13,14,15]. This cell-type-specific mosaicism could explain reports suggesting that de novo transposon insertions are more commonly found in brain compared to other somatic tissues [11, 16, 17] and that neuronal cells are more permissive to retrotransposition [5, 11]. However, a comprehensive study comparing somatic transposition rates across healthy human tissues has not been completed. In contrast, somatic retrotransposition is much more common in human cancers [18] with an estimated rate of 4–100 de novo insertions per tumor in many tumor types of different tissues [8, 19, 20]. The potential for similarly higher somatic rates has not been fully explored in disease settings outside of cancer.,In contrast to the relatively rare events of detectable de novo insertion, the most common molecular function of TEs is to generate RNAs. Many genomic TEs retain transcriptional regulatory sequences that can direct the generation of RNA transcripts, potentially including chimeric sequences downstream of the TEs themselves [21,22,23]. A subset of ERVs and L1 elements contain bidirectional promoters [21] capable of generating long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) [24]. Moreover, the density of sense and anti-sense copies of TEs embedded within introns and untranslated regions creates the potential to generate dsRNA segments from adjacent inverted repeats (IR), with Alu elements being the most common source of IR derived dsRNAs [25, 26]. When not properly degraded or resolved by adenosine deaminase, RNA specific (ADAR) editing complexes, long dsRNAs from retroelements can be recognized by DExD/H-Box Helicase 58 (DDX58/RIG-I), which alerts the antiviral surveillance machinery and activates inflammatory responses via interferon mediated Toll-Like Receptor pathways and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha [24]. In addition, if the TE RNAs are produced from a locus that encodes a functional reverse transcriptase, there exists the possibility for cytosolic cDNA production, which alerts a separate interferon-mediated inflammatory pathway downstream of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (CGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING/TMEM173) [24], as has previously been seen in aging mice expressing active LINE1 retrotransposons [27, 28]. Finally, some of the proteins generated from full length TE transcripts are directly 1) immunogenic in certain cancers [29, 30], and 2) cytotoxic in the case of HERV derived Envelope proteins in neurodegenerative diseases [31, 32].,In the case of neurological diseases, the best evidence for differential TE activity has come from detection of elevated TE-associated RNAs, cDNAs, and proteins in patient samples. While specific TE derived products have different consequences, the most commonly implicated pathogenic mechanisms are an inflammatory response to dsRNAs and/or cDNAs, or a direct cytotoxic response to specific proteins. The rest of this review will focus on the evidence for TE activity in four neurological disorders that have both evidence of TE products in diseased patient tissues as well as model organism support for pathogenicity downstream of TE activity. These include Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The diseases have been roughly divided into those that show evidence of retrotransposon induced general inflammation (AGS and MS) and those that show neurotoxic effects of retrotransposon products (ALS and AD). Figure 1 summarizes the evidence implicating retrotransposons in each of these diseases, which will be discussed in detail in the following sections. Table 1 provides a list of all named genes discussed in this review, both those that contribute to disease as well as those involved generally in retrotransposon regulation.,Transposable element (TE) activity in four neurological disorders: Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). In AGS and MS, TE nucleic acids and endogenous retroviral (ERV) proteins may be driving inflammation through innate immune sensing pathways. In ALS and AD, the pathogenic effects of TEs appear more localized to either motor neurons (in ALS), and hippocampal or cortical neurons (in AD). Innate immune pathways are activated by double-stranded RNAs and cDNAs produced by TE/ERV transcription and reverse transcription, respectively; this is the primary mechanism implicated in AGS, and could be at play in the other disorders. In addition, envelope proteins from the HERVW and HERVK class have been shown to be neurotoxic when expressed, and implicated in MS and ALS, respectively. Increased mobilization of fully competent TEs has not been convincingly demonstrated for any neurodegenerative disorder, though this mechanism has not been fully tested"

These methods are based on counting frequencies of short k-mer sequences, thus allowing faster and more robust analysis compared to traditional alignment-based methods.,We have created a fast alignment-free method, AluMine, to analyze polymorphic insertions of Alu elements in the human genome. We tested the method on 2,241 individuals from the Estonian Genome Project and identified 28,962 potential polymorphic Alu element insertions. Each tested individual had on average 1,574 Alu element insertions that were different from those in the reference genome. In addition, we propose an alignment-free genotyping method that uses the frequency of insertion/deletion-specific 32-mer pairs to call the genotype directly from raw sequencing reads. Using this method, the concordance between the predicted and experimentally observed genotypes was 98.7%. The running time of the discovery pipeline is approximately 2 h per individual. The genotyping of potential polymorphic insertions takes between 0.4 and 4 h per individual, depending on the hardware configuration.,AluMine provides tools that allow discovery of novel Alu element insertions and/or genotyping of known Alu element insertions from personal genomes within few hours.,More than 55% of the human genome contains repeated sequences [1,2,3,4]. These repeated sequences can be divided into tandem repeats and interspersed repeat elements (segmental duplications and transposable elements). The most abundant transposable element in the human genome is the Alu element. A typical Alu element is an approximately 300 bp long transposable nucleotide sequence [5,6,7]. The estimated number of full-length or partial Alu elements in the human genome is 1.1 million [8,9,10,11].,The presence or absence of some Alu elements is variable between individual genomes. Many Alu elements actively retrotranspose themselves into new locations, thus generating polymorphic Alu insertions [12,13,14]. A polymorphic Alu in this context refers to the presence or absence of the entire element and not single nucleotide polymorphisms within the Alu sequence. The insertion rate of Alu elements into new locations is approximately one insertion per 20 births [15, 16]. Polymorphic insertions of mobile DNA elements can disrupt coding regions, reprogram chromatin methylation patterns or disturb the regulation of flanking genes [17,18,19,20,21]. These changes in the genome can lead to disease [22,23,24,25]. Therefore, computational methods that reliably detect polymorphic Alu element insertions from sequencing data are needed.,Several methods for the identification of polymorphic Alu insertions have been developed that include the following: VariationHunter [26, 27], Hydra [28], TEA [29], RetroSeq [30], alu-detect [31] and Tangram [32], MELT [33], T-lex2 [34], STEAK [35], me-scan [36] and unnamed method used for analysing HGDP data [37]. All these methods are based on the mapping of sequencing reads and the subsequent interpretation of mapping results. The discovery of new insertions is typically based on split locations of a single read and/or the distance between paired reads.,Several databases or datasets that describe polymorphic Alu insertions are available. The oldest resource containing known polymorphic transposable elements is the dbRIP database [38]. It contains insertions detected by comparison of Human Genome Project data with Celera genome data. dbRIP also contains information about somatic Alu insertions that might be related to different diseases. The most comprehensive Alu element dataset is available from the 1000 Genome Project (1000G) [16, 33]. Phase 3 of the 1000G project studied 2504 individuals. They identified 1,236 Alu elements absent from the reference genome and 12,748 Alu elements inserted to the reference genome [33]. A subset of these sequences has been validated by Sanger sequencing [13].,We have developed a set of novel, alignment-free methods for the rapid discovery of polymorphic Alu insertions from fully sequenced individual genomes. In addition, we provide a method that calls genotypes with previously known insertions directly from raw reads. Evaluation of these methods was performed by computational simulations and PCR product size analysis."

                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0171-6,Transposable elementsArabidopsisGenome evolutionComparative genomics,"Transposable elements (TEs) are genomic parasites with major impacts on host genome architecture and host adaptation. A proper evaluation of their evolutionary significance has been hampered by the paucity of short scale phylogenetic comparisons between closely related species. Here, we characterized the dynamics of TE accumulation at the micro-evolutionary scale by comparing two closely related plant species, Arabidopsis lyrata and A. halleri.,Joint genome annotation in these two outcrossing species confirmed that both contain two distinct populations of TEs with either ‘recent’ or ‘old’ insertion histories. Identification of rare segregating insertions suggests that diverse TE families contribute to the ongoing dynamics of TE accumulation in the two species. Orthologous TE fragments (i.e. those that have been maintained in both species), tend to be located closer to genes than those that are retained in one species only. Compared to non-orthologous TE insertions, those that are orthologous tend to produce fewer short interfering RNAs, are less heavily methylated when found within or adjacent to genes and these tend to have lower expression levels. These findings suggest that long-term retention of TE insertions reflects their frequent acquisition of adaptive roles and/or the deleterious effects of removing nearly neutral TE insertions when they are close to genes.,Our results indicate a rapid evolutionary dynamics of the TE landscape in these two outcrossing species, with an important input of a diverse set of new insertions with variable propensity to resist deletion.,Transposable elements (TEs) are repeated elements found almost universally in eukaryotic genomes that can proliferate by high-jacking a variety of cellular processes. They are believed to be the substrate over which the non-coding fraction of the genome is formed in the long term [1] and contribute a large fraction of genome size variation across taxa, representing as much as 85% of the maize and barley genome and around 20% in A. thaliana [2,3,4,5]. Their spread in genomes is limited by mechanisms to suppress their transposition activity by host defense mechanisms including the production of dedicated classes of small non-coding RNAs (piRNA and siRNA) causing transcriptional silencing by RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) [6].,In spite of their quantitative importance, the evolutionary significance of TEs has been the subject of constant debate in the field. Their discovery was immediately followed by the interpretation that they must represent important “controlling elements” [7] that confer selective advantages to the organism and are a major “fuel” for evolution [6, 8]. This interpretation was soon challenged by the realization that TEs propagate in a largely selfish manner, and a large body of literature has considered them essentially as genomic parasites [9]. Over the last decade, however, molecular studies have reported convincing examples of TEs determining important evolutionary novelties and contributing to essential biological functions such as the rewiring of entire transcriptional networks [10]. Several iconic examples of rapid adaptive evolution have been linked to TE insertions such as the industrial melanism in the peppered moth [11] or the change in branching pattern that contributed to maize domestication [12]. Thanks to the regulatory elements they carry, TEs have also the capacity to confer environmental responsiveness to neighboring genes [13,14,15]. Hence, the duality of TEs, seen either as purely deleterious or as powerful drivers of rapid adaptive evolution has not been resolved today and the way natural selection is acting on TEs and how they accumulate in host genomes remain important questions in evolutionary genomics [16,17,18].,To achieve a more balanced view of TE evolution, one must therefore consider their accumulation as resulting from a complex balance between the rate and genomic locations at which they insert, the variety of their deleterious or beneficial effects and the rate at which they are removed from the genome through various recombination processes (reviewed in [19]). The landscape of TE abundance across the genome provides hints about the relative impact of these different forces. In Drosophila, recombination appears to play an important role in shaping the TE landscape, as TEs are rare in regions with a high rate of recombination and their population frequency negatively correlates with recombination [20]. In contrast, TE density does not correlate with recombination in A. thaliana [21], but distance to the nearest gene is strongly associated with disturbance of expression [22]. In this species, the deleterious effect of TEs thus seems to be mediated directly by their presence itself rather than indirectly by their tendency to cause ectopic recombination [21]. Hence, while examining abundance of TEs along a single genome provides insight into the selective forces involved, this correlative approach is inherently limited to a snapshot, with the caveat that a given pattern can arise from distinct evolutionary processes. For instance, the observation that TEs are typically found close to genes with low levels of expression can be due to either an insertion bias, a tendency of TE insertions to reduce the expression of adjacent genes, or generally weaker deleterious effects of TE insertions when adjacent genes are lowly rather than highly expressed [22, 23].,Different species exhibit strikingly diverse complements of TE families and superfamilies, demonstrating that evolutionary changes of this fraction of the genome can be dramatic. For instance, the majority of TEs in the pear genome [24] belong to the Copia superfamily, while in papaya [25] the same superfamily represents only a small fraction. It is unclear from comparing such distantly related species how fast these changes can take place, but striking differences have been observed even within species, with e.g. as much as 22% of genome size variation between two lines of maize mainly caused by TE differences [26] or a 30% increase in genome size in the Australian rice Oryza australiensis being caused by the recent activity of just three TE families [27]. However, because of their repetitive nature, it is generally challenging to follow the evolutionary fate of individual TE copies as soon as divergence increases. Hence, the limitation of this “global” approach is that it has limited power to pinpoint factors that prevent or promote the invasion of TEs within a given genome [13, 28, 29].,The Arabidopsis genus is a model of choice to study the dynamics of TEs [30]. Deep annotation by Maumus and Quesneville [23] of the repeated fraction of the high quality genome assemblies of the selfer A. thaliana [2] and the outcrosser A. lyrata [31] revealed that the fraction of the genome with substantial similarity to TE sequences was more important than previously appreciated, and consisted of two distinct populations of TE sequences. Beside a large number of sequences of short, likely degraded TE-derived sequences with an ancient insertion history in both genomes, there is a massive population of recently inserted TEs in A. lyrata (inserted within the last million years), which is largely absent from the A. thaliana genome [23]. The presence of TEs is associated with reduced levels of gene expression for TEs up to 2.5 kb away in A. thaliana, while in A. lyrata TEs as close as 1 kb are not associated with reduced expression of the nearby gene [32, 33]. Furthermore, He et al. [34] observed in F1 hybrids a consistent bias of TE transcript levels towards the A. lyrata copy, suggesting that A. lyrata TEs are less efficiently silenced than their A. thaliana orthologs, possibly as a result of differences in the methylation control machinery between the two species [30]. However, a comprehensive understanding of TE evolution in the Arabidopsis genus is difficult to obtain from this comparison alone [23], especially since the difference in mating system between the two species constitutes an important confounding factor [35,36,37].,To obtain a more general picture of how TEs evolve in the model Arabidopsis genus, it is thus essential to compare species with identical mating systems. To follow the evolutionary fate of individual TE copies, we studied the divergence of the TE repertoires of two closely related outcrossing species, A. lyrata and A. halleri that diverged less than 1 million years ago [38], including at an even finer scale the comparison between the subspecies A. halleri halleri and A. halleri gemmifera. These (sub) species remain phylogenetically close enough that TE insertions can be tracked individually. We find that these genomes host an abundant population of recently inserted TEs with almost identical insertion ages, although only a very small fraction are found at orthologous positions, indicating a very rapid turnover of these sequences. The small fraction of TE-derived sequences that is retained over the long run displays distinctive features, with gene proximity an important factor favoring TE retention. We argue that while TE accumulation in genomes has typically been studied in light of the dynamics of new insertions, their propensity for long-term retention by resisting deletion is also an important factor."

However, in light of new advances in sequencing technology, such as increased read length and paired-end libraries, these repetitive regions are now becoming easier to align to. This study investigates the mappability of transposable elements with 50 bp, 76 bp and 100 bp paired-end read libraries. With respect to those read lengths and allowing for 3 mismatches during alignment, over 68, 85, and 88% of all transposable elements in the RepeatMasker database are uniquely mappable, suggesting that accurate locus-specific mapping of older transposable elements is well within reach.,Sequences from transposable elements (TE) have been observed to account for an average of 7% of reads from human RNA-Seq datasets [1]. Because of the repetitive nature of TE sequences, fragments originating from locus-specific TEs are challenging to accurately align to a reference genome. However, RNA-Seq protocols now allow for paired-end reads up to 150 bp long which theoretically should substantially increase the ability to confidently map to repetitive regions [2]. Mappability of the genome has been analyzed before, and several representations have been proposed, including pair-wise cross mappability, and minimum unique length [3,4,5,6], but no study has investigated the mappability of TE regions in light of differences in read lengths and paired-end sequencing. The purpose of our study is to assess which TEs can be confidently quantified at the locus-specific level, rather than at the aggregated family level. We provide base level mappability of TEs in detail and show that a significant fraction of TEs are uniquely mappable at the element level.,Mappability has been defined for the genome by Derrien et al. as the inverse of the number of times a k-mer originating from the genome appears in the genome, considering its reverse complement and allowing a limited number of mismatches [5]. We follow this definition to attain mappability scores for all TE regions in the RepeatMasker database using both the GEM (GEnome Multitool) Mappability and Bowtie programs [5, 7].,Several factors affect the ability to accurately map a sequencing read to its originating locus which are not accounted for in this analysis. These include sequencing errors in the reads, true variants between the genome which was sequenced and the reference genome, and the accuracy of the alignment software used to map the reads. Both random sequencing errors and true genomic variants can potentially create sequencing reads that are not present in the genome [8, 9]. Such reads are not generated in the simulation in this analysis, but by allowing for up to 3 mismatches for each read in our alignment, we are capturing possible mappings to potential errors and variants up to 3 nucleotides for every sequence of read length in the genome. Also, since no alignment software maps sequencing reads perfectly [1], we compare our estimates of mappability based on two independent alignment algorithms, GEM and Bowtie, and check whether the estimates are largely congruent between the two methods.,Additional factors which affect the ability to discern the originating position of reads when looking at TE loci specifically include the copy number of the TE subfamily [10], the Hamming distance between related loci relative to the allowed mismatch rate and, importantly, the accuracy of TE annotations. In this analysis we use the Repeatmasker TE annotation database for all TE classifications, but the current lack of benchmarking methods for TE annotation likely results in missing annotations or incorrect annotations even in this database [11]. Our analysis takes this fact into consideration as we have calculated mappability scores for the entire genome and therefore TE locus level scores would be simple to recalculate based on any future updates to TE annotations.,In our analysis, we provide a specific mappability score which represents the ability of Bowtie software to map a read pair uniquely to a locus when allowing for up to 3 mismatches. Although this is a very specific definition of mappability and we cannot account for all of the above listed confounding factors, these scores provide an estimate of the sequence uniqueness under particular parameters and assumptions [12]. While mappability scores are not directly related to how well a read maps to a region, they do provide a conservative estimate of the uniqueness of a sequence which can inform on the resulting confidence of a read mapping.,We have provided six new hg38 mappability tracks for the UCSC browser as well as provided aggregate mappability scores for each TE locus found in the RepeatMasker database. We show that more than 85% of TE loci are considered to be unique in terms of 76 bp paired-end mappability allowing for 3 mismatches using the Bowtie aligner. Because these TE loci have unique mappability scores, we present these TE loci as a high confidence set that researchers can utilize as a reference for studying TE expression based on RNA-seq."

              Dot COMYb-bodyDrosophilaOogenesis","PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are the effectors of transposable element silencing in the reproductive apparatus. In Drosophila ovarian somatic cells, piRNAs arise from long RNA precursors presumably processed within cytoplasmic Yb-bodies.,Here we show that the nucleo-cytoplasmic traffic of piRNA precursors encoded by the flamenco locus is subjected to a spatio-temporal regulation. Precursor RNAs first gather in a single nuclear focus, Dot COM, close to the nuclear periphery, and transit through the membrane before being delivered to the cytoplasmic Yb-bodies. Early in oogenesis, flamenco transcripts are rapidly transferred to the cytoplasm making their initial nuclear gathering in Dot COM too transient to be visualized. As oogenesis proceeds, the cytoplasmic delivery steadily decreases concomitantly with the decrease in the protein levels of Armi and Yb, two components of the Yb-bodies. Both events lead to a reduction of Yb-body assembly in late stages of oogenesis, which likely results in a drop in piRNA production.,Our findings show a spatio-temporal regulation of the piRNA biogenesis in the follicle cells of Drosophila ovaries, that involves coordinated control of both piRNA precursors and components of the piRNA processing machinery. This newly unveiled regulation establishes another level of complexity in the production of piRNAs and suggests a stage-dependent involvement of the piRNA biogenesis in the mechanism of transposable elements silencing along oogenesis.,Eukaryotic genomes are composed of a variable proportion of transposable elements (TEs) accumulated throughout evolution. These sequences are silenced by the host to protect itself and its progeny against potentially deleterious mutations and genome invasion. In the gonads, where it is essential to ensure the maintenance of genome integrity for the next generation, the piRNA pathway is responsible for TE silencing in both somatic and germinal tissues [1,2,3,4]. This process involves small guide piRNAs of 23–29 nucleotides (nts) that originate from discrete genomic regions called piRNA clusters.,142 piRNA clusters have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster [2], mostly located in pericentromeric and telomeric regions. These clusters vary considerably in size from a few kilobases (kb) to several hundred kb. They are enriched in full length or truncated TEs that are often nested within one another [2, 5]. In ovarian somatic support cells surrounding the germline, piRNAs are mainly produced from two piRNA clusters: traffic jam [6] and flamenco (flam) [2, 7]. The flam cluster is located at the pericentromeric region of the X-chromosome, spans over more than 200 kb and is strongly enriched in both ancient and recent retrotransposons mostly inserted in an orientation antisense to the TE transcription [5]. flam is transcribed from a polymerase II promoter as a long single-stranded RNA that is a substrate for piRNA biogenesis. Flam transcripts undergo alternative splicing to generate diverse piRNA precursors that all share the first exon at their 5′ end [8]. These transcripts are then processed into 23–29 nt piRNAs, presumably in cytoplasmic Yb-bodies [9, 10]. Mature piRNAs associated with Piwi protein form a piRNA-induced silencing complex (piRISC) that is delivered to the nucleus to target nascent TE mRNAs and initiate transcriptional gene silencing [11, 12].,Two studies have reported that flam precursor transcripts, together with transcripts from other piRNA clusters, concentrate in 1 to 2 foci in ovarian follicle cells [13, 14]. Analysis of the subcellular localization of these sites of accumulation at different stages of development have yielded varying findings. The first study focused on follicle cells in late stages of oogenesis and showed that flam RNA precursors accumulate in a single nuclear substructure, named Dot COM, that faces the cytoplasmic Yb-body to which the flam precursors are channeled by nucleo-cytoplasmic transfer [13]. A subsequent report [14] visualized flam transcripts concentrated within the cytoplasm in 1 to 2 substructures named flam bodies, located close to Yb-bodies. The authors worked mainly with a cultured Drosophila ovarian somatic stem cell line (OSS cells) derived from a somatic stem cell population of the germarium [15] that expresses a functional piRNA pathway [6].,We show here that flam transcripts are channeled to the cytoplasm in a temporally regulated manner. In early stages of oogenesis, they are mainly detected within the cytoplasm. As oogenesis proceeds, flam transcripts accumulate in a focus detected within the nucleus or within the nuclear membrane as though their delivery to the cytoplasm was impeded. Combined with a drop in Armi and Yb protein levels after stage 8, this affects the assembly of Yb-bodies which then are very small and absent from most cells. These findings emphasize the temporal regulation of Yb-body assembly, which requires both cytoplasmic flam delivery and Armi and Yb proteins. In their absence, Yb-bodies fail to assemble correctly, which potentially can cause a decrease in the production of piRNAs."
27,Amplification of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements and the associated impact on gene regulation and alternative splicing in mulberry (Morus notabilis),Published on: 25 June 2019,"Authors: Youchao Xin, Bi Ma, Zhonghuai Xiang and Ningjia He","
                            Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are common in eukaryotic genomes, and are important for genomic evolution.
                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0169-0,MITEsAmplificationGene expressionSmall RNAAlternative splicing,"Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are common in eukaryotic genomes, and are important for genomic evolution.,In the present study, the identification of MITEs in the mulberry genome revealed 286,122 MITE-related sequences, including 90,789 full-length elements. The amplification of mulberry MITEs and the influence of MITEs on the evolution of the mulberry genome were analyzed. The timing of MITE amplifications varied considerably among the various MITE families. Fifty-one MITE families have undergone a single round of amplification, while the other families developed from multiple amplifications. Most mulberry MITEs were inserted near genes and some could regulate gene expression through small RNAs. An analysis of transgenic plants indicated that MITE insertions can upregulate the expression of a target gene. Moreover, MITEs are frequently associated with alternative splicing events (exonizations).,The data presented herein provide insights into the generation of MITEs as well as their impact on gene regulation and evolution in mulberry.,Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are very short, deletion derivatives of autonomous DNA transposons [1, 2]. They were originally discovered in the maize genome, and are widespread among animals and plants [3, 4]. MITEs and autonomous DNA transposons share common characteristics, including the presence of a terminal inverted-repeat (TIR) flanked by a target site duplication (TSD). The TIR and TSD suggest that most MITEs are derived from autonomous DNA elements, including Tc1/Mariner elements [5], PIF/Harbinger [1, 6, 7], hAT [8, 9], and Mutator [10]. Although MITEs lack an open reading frame encoding a transposase, their transposition is mediated by transposases associated with autonomous DNA transposons [11, 12].,In plants, MITEs often cover a considerable portion of the genome, including up to 10% of the Oryza sativa genome and 8% of the Medicago truncatula genome [13]. In rice, active MITEs have been detected (e.g., mPing and mGing) [11, 14], and the Stowaway MITE has been developed as a genetic engineering tool for transferring heterogeneous genes [15]. MITEs are often transcribed with plant genes [16, 17], and can influence genomic evolution and gene expression [18,19,20,21,22]. Specifically, MITEs usually downregulate gene expression [17, 23, 24], but MITEs containing regulatory motifs can have the opposite effect [20, 22]. Furthermore, MITEs can encode small RNAs that regulate the expression of target genes at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels [17, 25]. The structural similarity between MITEs and microRNA genes suggests that MITE-derived small RNAs may be generated via the microRNA pathway [26]. However, the MITE-derived small RNAs in Solanaceae species are most likely generated by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis pathway [17]. Additionally, small RNAs derived from MITEs are important for silencing transposable elements (TEs) through stem-loop structures [27].,Alternative splicing is a common post-transcriptional regulatory process that increases transcriptome and proteome diversity in eukaryotic organisms. Alternative splicing is reportedly important for development [28, 29] and stress responses [30, 31]. Analyses of RNA sequences have revealed abundant alternatively spliced, intron-containing transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana (61%), Oryza sativa (33%), Zea mays (40%), and Glycine max (63%) [32,33,34,35]. Moreover, alternative splicing based on TE activities has been confirmed in previous studies. For example, more than 5% of the alternative splicing occurring in humans is associated with Alu elements [36]. Additionally, in A. thaliana, more than half of the expressed Ty1/Copia elements are spliced [37]. Another study proved that Alu elements help modulate alternative splicing [38]. However, it remains unclear whether MITEs can mediate alternative splicing in plants.,Mulberry (Morus sp.) is a well-known food source for silkworms (Bombyx mori L.) and is an economically, ecologically, and medically important plant species. Morus notabilis has a relatively small genome (approximately 357 Mb), which has been sequenced [39]. Its genomic data may be useful for thoroughly characterizing mulberry MITEs. In this study, we identified the MITEs in the mulberry genome and analyzed their amplification patterns, effects on gene regulation, and evolution."

              IncA/C plasmidCytosine-specific DNA methylaseRestriction modification systemMultidrug resistance","IncA/C plasmids play important roles in the development and dissemination of multidrug resistance in bacteria. These plasmids carry three methylase genes, two of which show cytosine specificity. The effects of such a plasmid on the host methylome were observed by single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) and bisulfite sequencing in this work.,The results showed that the numbers of methylation sites on the host chromosomes were changed, as were the sequences recognized by MTase. The host chromosomes were completely remodified by the plasmid with a methylation pattern different from that of the host itself. When the three dcm genes were deleted, the transferability of the plasmid into other Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli strains was lost. During deletion of the dcm genes, except for the wild-type strains and the targeted deletion strains, 18.7%~ 38.5% of the clones lost the IncA/C plasmid and changed from erythromycin-, azithromycin- and tetracycline-resistant strains to strains that were sensitive to these antibiotics.,Methylation of the IncA/C plasmid was a new mobile restriction modification (RM) barrier against foreign DNA. By actively changing the host’s methylation pattern, the plasmid crossed the barrier of the host’s RM system, and this might be the simplest and most universal method by which plasmids acquire a broad host range. Elimination of plasmids by destruction of plasmid stability could be a new effective strategy to address bacterial multidrug resistance.,Antibiotic resistance, especially multidrug resistance, is a serious challenge worldwide. Many bacterial drug resistance genes are stored in plasmids and can be horizontally transferred to other bacteria. The IncA/C family plasmids are major members of these plasmids [1, 2]. Both of the famous plasmids, namely, pIP1202, which exhibits high resistance to at least eight antibiotics and was isolated from Yersinia pestis in 1995 [3], and the NDM-1 plasmid, which was isolated from superresistant bacteria in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Britain and the United States in August 2010 [4], are IncA/C plasmids. These plasmids have generated much concern with regard to public health and bioterrorism. IncA/C plasmids have the ability to robustly accumulate antibiotic resistance genes. There are many resistance genes against rifampicin, erythromycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides and disinfectants that are routinely harbored on these plasmids [5], in addition to a variety of beta-lactamase genes harbored by the pNDM-1_Dok01, pNDM102337, pNDM10469, pNDM10505, pNDMCFuy, pNDM-KN and pNDM-US plasmids of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The pVC211 plasmid that we isolated from Vibrio cholerae has 16 antibiotic resistance-related genes, including five macrolide resistance genes that utilize three mechanisms [6]. The IncA/C plasmid made 99% of Chinese V. cholerae O139 strains resistant to more than three antibiotics, and 47% resistant to eight antibiotics [7].,Another striking feature of the IncA/C plasmids is their wide host range. These plasmids exist and are transferred horizontally in many bacterial species and genera, such as E. coli, Salmonella, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, V. cholerae, Yersinia, Pantoea, Edwardsiella, Citrobacter freundii, Photobacterium damselae, Aeromonas, Xenorhabdus nematophila, and Providencia, with transformation efficiencies as high as 10− 1 to 10− 2. In addition, the skeleton of the IncA/C plasmid is also widely distributed in agricultural multidrug-resistant pathogens. Strains carrying IncA/C plasmids have been isolated from cows, chickens, turkeys and pigs. Reports have shown that the blaCMY-2 gene on the IncA/C plasmid that confers resistance to cephalosporin could be identified in human E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates several years after the prevalence of the gene in edible animals [8]. Moreover, 1% of E. coli strains isolated from healthy people who had never taken antibiotics were positive for the repA/C gene, the replicator of the IncA/C plasmid [9, 10]. This mobile reservoir of drug resistance genes can transmit multidrug resistance phenotypes from foodborne pathogens to human pathogens, which demonstrates that the use of veterinary drugs can affect human drug resistance profiles, and the IncA/C plasmids have special public health implications.,IncA/C plasmids are large, conjugative plasmids that are approximately 150 kb in length. On the plasmid backbones, there are three methylation-related genes: dcm1, dcm2, and dcm3, which are 1626 bp, 1428 bp and 924 bp in length and are identical to the NCBI reference sequences WP_000201432.1, WP_000936896.1 and WP_000501488.1, respectively. The dcm1 gene encodes Gammaproteobacteria cytosine-C5 specific DNA methylase (MTase) of the Pfam PF00145 family. The dcm2 gene is a DNA cytosine methyltransferase with an AdoMet_MTase (cl17173) conserved domain. The dcm3 gene is a DNA modification MTase that lacks any known conserved domain. These three methylation genes are broadly conserved in IncA/C2 plasmids, although a few plasmids have lost the dcm2 gene due to a deletion event associated with the ARI-B resistance island [2]. There are six methylation-related genes in the host genome of V. cholerae: three adenine-specific MTases (dam: VC1769, VC2118, and VC2626), two rRNA MTases (VC2697 and VCA0627), and one orphan cytosine MTase, vchM (VCA0158). Generally, DNA (cytosine-5-specific) MTase (Dcm) recognizes the CCWGG motif and covalently adds a methyl group at the C5 position of the second cytosine, while Dam introduces a methyl group at the N6 position of the adenine in the GATC motif. The MTases encoded in the V. cholerae chromosomes are mainly Dam MTases, and the only Dcm MTase, VchM, recognizes a novel target, the first 5’C on both strands of the palindromic sequence 5′-RCCGGY-3′, and leaves all 5′-CCWGG-3′ sites unmethylated in V. cholerae [11]. These data suggest that the changes in DNA methylation mediated by the IncA/C plasmids may be different from those in the host chromosomes.,DNA methylation is a central epigenetic modification in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and repair [12], transcriptional modulation, lowering of transformation frequency, and stabilization of short direct repeats in certain bacteria; in addition, DNA methylation is necessary for site-directed mutagenesis [13]. DNA methylation acts either alone or as a part of the bacterial restriction modification (RM) system that protects the host from infection of foreign DNA and bacteriophages by degrading nonmethylated DNA with sequence-specific restriction enzymes. Although the role of IncA/C plasmids in drug resistance is well elucidated, the role of the dcm genes on A/C2 plasmids remains largely unexplored. In this study, the IncA/C plasmid pVC211 (148,456 bp) [6] was conjugated into V. cholerae strain C6706. Genome-wide bisulfite sequencing and single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing [14, 15] were conducted to provide a global view of the changes in the methylation patterns of the host DNA that were induced by this plasmid."

              Transposable elementsHorizontal transferInsectsGenome evolution","Helitrons play an important role in shaping eukaryotic genomes due to their ability to transfer horizontally between distantly related species and capture gene fragments during the transposition. However, the mechanisms of horizontal transfer (HT) and the process of gene fragment capturing of Helitrons still remain to be further clarified.,Here, we characterized a novel Helitron family discontinuously distributed in 27 out of 256 insect genomes. The most prominent characteristic of Hel1 family is its high sequence similarity among species of different insect orders. Related elements were also identified in two spiders, representing the first report of spider Helitrons. All these elements were classified into 2 families, 9 subfamilies and 35 exemplars based on our new classification criteria. Autonomous partners of Helitron were reconstructed in the genomes of three insects and one spider. Integration pattern analysis showed that majority of Hel1A elements in Papilio xuthus and Pieris rapae inserted into introns. Consistent with filler DNA model, stepwise sequence acquisition was observed in Sfru_Hel1Aa, Sfru_Hel1Ab and Sfru_Hel1Ac in Spodoptera frugiperda. Remarkably, the evidence that Prap_Hel1Aa in a Lepdidoptera insect, Pieris rapae, was derived from Cves_Hel1Aa in a parasitoid wasp, Cotesia vestalis, suggested the role of nonregular host-parasite interactions in HT of Helitrons.,We proposed a modified classification criteria of Helitrons based on the important role of the 5′-end of Helitrons in transposition, and provided evidence for stepwise sequence acquisition and recurrent HT of a novel Helitron family. Our findings of the nonregular host-parasite interactions may be more conducive to the HT of transposons.,As the single largest component of the genetic material of most eukaryotic and proeukaryotic species, transposable elements (TEs) play key roles in the epigenetic regulation of the genome and generation of genomic novelty [1, 2]. Depending on the mode of transposition, TEs are traditionally categorized as class-I elements or retrotransposons and class-II elements or DNA transposons [1, 3]. Copy and paste retrotransposons replicate via reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate of a source element, and can be further divided into long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons. DNA transposons move through a single or double-stranded DNA intermediate, and are classified into three major subclasses, including the classic “cut-and-paste” transposons, rolling-circle (RC) transposons called Helitrons, and self-synthesizing transposons called Mavericks/Polintons. Both retrotransposons and DNA transposons exist as self-mobilizing autonomous elements or non-autonomous elements relying on trans-mobilization by the enzymatic machinery of their autonomous counterparts [4].,Helitrons, a novel superfamily of transposons, were originally discovered by in silico genome-sequence analysis [5], and later identified in a wide range of organisms, from protists to mammals [6, 7]. Helitrons are fundamentally different from classical transposons in terms of enzymatic activity and structure. Helitrons encode a RepHel protein homologous to RCR prokaryotic transposases, which comprises the replication initiator (Rep) and helicase (Hel) domains and is predicted to have both HUH (His-hydrophobe-His) endonuclease activity and 5′ to 3′ helicase activity [8]. Helitrons do not create target site duplications or contain terminal inverted repeats, and recent studies show that they transpose via copy-and-paste rather than cut-and-paste mechanism [9]. The characteristic features of Helitrons include a ‘TC’ motif on the 5′-end and a ‘CTRR’ motif on the 3′-end, and a palindromic sequence of 16–20 bp near the 3′-end, which can form a hairpin structure. Because of the minimal sequence feature and high sequence heterogeneity among Helitron copies, a classification system for family and subfamily definition has been proposed based on genome-wide analysis of Helitrons in the maize, Zea mays [10].,Helitrons have attracted widespread attention because their remarkable ability to capture gene fragments at the DNA level makes them play an important role in the host genome evolution. This process appears to have been particularly remarkable in the maize genome, where it is estimated that at least 20,000 gene fragments have been picked up and shuffled by Helitrons [10,11,12]. High frequency of Helitron-mediated gene capture is also reported in bats [13]. A recent study revealed that Helitrons have captured 3724 fragments from 268 genes in the silkworm, Bombyx mori [14]. Several models have been proposed to explain the mechanism of gene capture at the DNA level including end bypass and filler DNA model [8, 15].,Horizontal transfer (HT) is the non-vertical exchange of genetic material between reproductively isolated species. The inherent mobility and replication abilities of TEs facilitate them to undergo vector-mediated HT between organisms to avoid co-evolved host suppression mechanisms leading to vertical inactivation [1, 16,17,18]. The first evidence for the repeated HT of four different families of Helitrons including Heligloria, Helisimi, Heliminu, and Helianu, was described in an unprecedented array of organisms, including mammals, reptiles, fish, invertebrates, and polydnaviruses [19]. Subsequent identification of horizontally transferred Helitrons, such as Hel-2 [20], Lep1 [21], suggesting that Helitrons rely heavily on HT for their propagation and maintenance throughout evolution [21]. However, the physiological or ecological factors favoring the high frequency of HT still remains elusive.,Here, we have conducted a thorough search for the distribution of a novel Helitron family by analyzing the sequenced genomes of 256 insects and 22 spiders. We found that Hel1 elements distributed in 27 investigated insect genomes as well as the genome of a distantly related spider, Nephila clavipes, which were classified into 9 subfamilies and 34 exemplars. A related Hel2 family was identified in the genome of a spider, Parasteatoda tepidariorum. Furthermore, we provided evidence for stepwise sequence acquisition and recurrent HT of this novel Helitron family. Our results provided new insights into the classification and evolution of Helitrons, and suggested that the Helitrons can undergo horizontal transfer by diverse means."

Our understanding of the mechanisms of such events is at an early stage. The close physical relationship between a parasite and its host could facilitate horizontal transfer. To date, two studies have identified horizontal transfer of RTEs, a class of retrotransposable elements, involving parasites: ticks might act as vector for BovB between ruminants and squamates, and AviRTE was transferred between birds and parasitic nematodes.,We searched for RTEs shared between nematode and mammalian genomes. Given their physical proximity, it was necessary to detect and remove sequence contamination from the genome datasets, which would otherwise distort the signal of horizontal transfer. We developed an approach that is based on reads instead of genomic sequences to reliably detect contamination. From comparison of 43 RTEs across 197 genomes, we identified a single putative case of horizontal transfer: we detected RTE1_Sar from Sorex araneus, the common shrew, in parasitic nematodes. From the taxonomic distribution and evolutionary analysis, we show that RTE1_Sar was horizontally transferred.,We identified a new horizontal RTE transfer in host-parasite interactions, which suggests that it is not uncommon. Further, we present and provide the workflow a read-based method to distinguish between contamination and horizontal transfer.,Transposable elements, or transposons, are DNA elements vertically transmitted in eukaryotes, from parents to offspring and ancestral to descendant species. In some cases however, a transposon might be horizontally transferred between different species, that is, transferred between species by other means than vertical transfer. BovB (Bovine-B), a non-LTR retrotransposable element present in ruminants and squamates, has been extensively studied as the first case of a horizontal transfer of a retrotransposable element between eukaryotes [1–3]. Recently, two other cases of horizontal transfers of non-LTR elements have been reported: AviRTE has been detected in birds and human parasitic filarial nematodes including the eye worm Loa loa [4], and LINE-1 has possibly been transferred between marine eukaryotes [3]. It has been hypothesized that transposons survive longer if they escape host silencing mechanisms through horizontal transfer [5]. Although the mechanisms of HTTs are still unclear, they could be facilitated by parasites and pathogens [5–7]. Parasites have long lasting, physical contact to their hosts, which increases the chances of HTT either directly or through a secondary pathogen. There have been numerous reports of HTT between parasites and their hosts. In nematodes, in addition to the previously mentioned AviRTE, the DNA transposon bandit has possibly transferred between hookworms and humans [8]. In ectoparasites, ticks are the likely intermediate for the spread of BovB [2], but the bed bug (Cimex lectularius) and the leech (Helobdella robusta) have also been indicated as potential vectors of BovB [3]. The kissing bug (Rhodnius prolixus), blood feeder and vector of Chagas’ disease, harbors multiple horizontally transferred transposons: DNA transposons SPIN and OC1 share over 95% consensus sequence identity between the kissing bug and its hosts, opossums and squirrel monkeys [6].,After being horizontally transferred, transposons can have significant impacts on the recipient organisms. They can proliferate in the host genome and increase the genome size significantly. The genome of the strawberry poison frog (Oophaga pumilio) is 6.76 Gb large, 4.76 Gb of which are repetitive elements. These include transposons which continued to proliferate after horizontal transfer from other species, possibly lizard and fish [9]. Transposons and their intra-genomic movement can lead to changes in a species’ genotype and phenotype (reviewed by [10, 11]). Transfers of transposons between species have been shown to support the creation of new genes [12]. In tomatoes, insertion of a retrotransposon called Rider into the PSY1 gene leads to a yellow phenotype of the fruit, while duplication of the SUN gene mediated by Rider leads to the elongated fruit shape of Roma tomatoes [7]. Rider was horizontally transferred between the lineages of Arabidopsis and tomato plants.,It is important to distinguish horizontal transfer from contamination of genetic material for example during sample collection. This is not a simple task but necessary if we are to understand if and how frequent horizontal transfers occur, and what the involved species are. Contamination has been previously erroneously identified as horizontal transfer in the literature [13]. The close physical and molecular association between a parasite and its host makes determining horizontal transfer a great challenge. We developed a new approach to distinguish between contamination and horizontal transfer that is similar in concept to existing methods. A common strategy to test for contamination is to examine flanking regions of transposon insertions [3]. If the flanking region does not originate from the organism, the transposon is also considered as contamination. Another strategy is to compare the coverage of sequence reads at the transposon and in flanking regions [14]. To remove the factor of genome assembly issues that arise with repetitive regions, we devised a simple strategy to directly determine contamination at the read level. In contrast to genome assemblies, read pairs and long reads are derived from a contiguous strand of DNA. Our approach takes reads that code for an RTE, and identifies the origin of the non-repetitive part of the read pairs or long reads (see Methods).,Given the previously documented horizontal transfers of BovB and AviRTE, the question arises whether RTEs are prone to horizontal transfer between parasites and hosts. We investigated RTEs in 33 mammalian and 10 nematode - free-living and parasitic - species, to identify potential horizontal transfers. We found RTE1_Sar from S. araneus and BovB from ruminants in parasitic nematodes, and with subsequent analysis confirmed RTE1_Sar as the only HTT case. BovB has been analyzed previously in multiple studies, but is has not been reported in nematodes: in fact, Ivancevic and colleagues reported BovB explicitly as absent in 12 nematode species [3]. This raised the question of whether the finding of RTE1_Sar in S. araneus and BovB in several nematodes resulted from misassemblies due to contamination from/to endoparasites. We developed a simple approach to test for contamination based on long or paired-end reads, and confidently showed that BovB in H. contortus is likely derived from a contamination, and that RTE1_Sar is a true endogenous element in the S. araneus genome. We tested for horizontal transfer of RTE1_Sar between S. araneus and nematodes by estimating a phylogeny and relative RTE1_Sar copy ages. We found that RTE1_Sar was probably horizontally transferred between an unsampled parasitic nematode and S. araneus after the split of the lineages leading to S. araneus and the hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus, ca. 60 million years ago (mya) [15])."

Most of the sequence-specific LINEs have been reported mainly among invertebrate species and shown to retrotranspose into the specific sequences in vivo and in vitro systems. Recenlty, 28S rDNA-specific LINE R2 elements are shown to be distributed among widespread vertebrate species, but the sequence-specific retrotransposition of R2 has never been demonstrated in vertebrates.,Here we cloned a full length unit of R2 from medaka fish Oryzias latipes, named R2Ol, and engineered it to a targeted gene integration tool in zebrafish. By injecting R2Ol-encoding mRNA into zebrafish embryos, R2Ol retrotransposed precisely into the target site at high efficiency (98%) and was transmitted to the next generation at high frequency (50%). We also generated transgenic zebrafish carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene in 28S rDNA target by the R2Ol retrotransposition system.,Sequence-specific LINE retrotransposes into the precise sequence using target primed reverse transcription (TPRT), possibly providing an alternative and effective targeted gene knockin method in vertebrates.,Precisely targeted gene integration technologies that can enable transgene expression while avoiding unpredictable phenotypes caused by random integration are desirable. In terms of the safety aspect, sequence-specificity is the most important subject associated with transgene integration at targeted harmless genomic sites for therapeutic purposes in human cells [1]. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats / CRISPR associated proteins (CRISPR/Cas9) system is the most powerful and prevalent genetic engineering tool system which induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the target site, stimulating two cellular DNA repair pathways: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homology directed repair (HDR). The error-prone NHEJ process generates small insertions or deletions at the DSB site, causing knockout of the target sequence. Alternatively, HDR results in gene knockin at the target site in the presence of donor DNA. The HDR efficiency is relatively low compared with NHEJ [2, 3], and designing the donor DNA is time-consuming. Some strategies to increase HDR efficiency, such as utilization of nickase or dead Cas9 (dCas9) [4, 5], inhibition of NHEJ [6, 7], usage of asymmetric donor DNA [8], and cell cycle synchronization [9], have been employed. However, the molecular mechanism of donor DNA template-dependent HDR requires further elucidation [3], and off-target concerns [10] as well as cancer risk [11, 12] should be monitored. Thus, another system independent of HDR might provide an alternative solution for efficiently targeted gene knockin.,Long interspersed elements (LINEs), one class of non-LTR-retrotransposon, encode reverse transcriptase (RT) and endonuclease (EN) domains that nick one strand of DNA at the target site to create a 3′-hydroxyl end, which is used as a primer for the reverse transcription of LINE mRNA into the DNA target [13]. This unique process, called target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT), is peculiar to LINEs. Although many LINEs, such as human L1, retrotranspose almost randomly into the genome, there are various sequence-specific LINEs that integrate with specific sequences within a target site, such as rDNA, telomeric repeats, microsatellites, and others [14,15,16]. In vivo sequence-specific retrotransposition systems for some sequence-specific elements, such as telomere-specific SART1 and TRAS1 [17], 28S rDNA-specific R1Bm [18], and 18S rDNA-specific R7Ag [19], have been established in insect cells using a baculovirus vector. The most studied sequence-specific element R2Bm of the silkworm, also exhibited the efficient sequence-specific retrotransposition activity both in vitro [13] and in vivo [20], contributing to understanding the general mechanism of LINE retrotransposition. The target specificity of these elements is quite rigid, making them suitable for targeted gene integration tools in widespread species [14], although no system has been reported in vertebrates. Most sequence-specific LINEs have been detected only in arthropod and invertebrate species. However, we have recently found that 28S rDNA-specific R2 is widely distributed among vertebrate species, but not mammals [16, 21]. It is noteworthy that all R2 elements found in various species are inserted into the same sequence within 28S rDNA, an approximately 200 bp region surrounded by strongly conserved sequences across a wide variety of eukaryote [14] (Additional file 1: Fig. S1), suggesting the high sequence specificity of this element."

                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0164-5,,"L1 retrotransposons have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts for the entire history of mammals and currently compose ~ 20% of a mammalian genome. B1 retrotransposons are dependent on L1 for retrotransposition and span the evolutionary history of rodents since their radiation. L1s were found to have lost their activity in a group of South American rodents, the Sigmodontinae, and B1 inactivation preceded the extinction of L1 in the same group. Consequently, a basal group of sigmodontines have active L1s but inactive B1s and a derived clade have both inactive L1s and B1s. It has been suggested that B1s became extinct during a long period of L1 quiescence and that L1s subsequently reemerged in the basal group.,Here we investigate the evolutionary histories of L1 and B1 in the sigmodontine rodents and show that L1 activity continued until after the L1-extinct clade and the basal group diverged. After the split, L1 had a small burst of activity in the former group, followed by extinction. In the basal group, activity was initially low but was followed by a dramatic increase in L1 activity. We found the last wave of B1 retrotransposition was large and probably preceded the split between the two rodent clades.,Given that L1s had been steadily retrotransposing during the time corresponding to B1 extinction and that the burst of B1 activity preceding B1 extinction was large, we conclude that B1 extinction was not a result of L1 quiescence. Rather, the burst of B1 activity may have contributed to L1 extinction both by competition with L1 and by putting strong selective pressure on the host to control retrotransposition.,LINEs (Long INterspersed Elements) are autonomous non-LTR retrotransposons. They move through an RNA intermediate, but have non-homologous ends and use target-primed reverse transcription [1]. L1 (LINE-1) is the most successful family of LINEs in eutherian mammals [2] and comprise ~ 20% of a mammalian genome [3,4,5,6,7]. A functional full-length L1 is typically 6000–7000 bp long and composed of a 5′ untranslated region (5’UTR) harboring an RNA polymerase II promoter, two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) known as ORF1 and ORF2 and a 3’UTR followed by a poly-adenosine sequence [8]. The structure of L1 can be diverse among different mammals, particularly in the 5’UTR and ORF1 [5]. The ORF-encoded proteins are strictly required for L1 retrotransposition and are highly cis-preferential [9, 10]. L1s are adenosine rich (~ 40%) on their coding strand, which results in biased codon usage compared to host genes [11, 12], elongation defects [13], and premature RNA splicing [14]. This A-richness contributes to the inefficiency of L1 retrotransposition and is proposed to regulate the genes in their vicinity [13].,SINEs (Short INterspersed Elements) are relatively short, non-autonomous, non-LTR retrotransposons. SINEs do not encode proteins for their own retrotransposition and depend on the reverse transcriptase encoded by other transposable elements such as LINEs [15, 16]. Although L1s are highly cis-preferential [9, 10], SINEs can take advantage of L1-encoded proteins for their own retrotransposition [15,16,17], and L1 ORF2 protein is sufficient to drive B1 retrotransposition. Despite their short length, SINEs account for ~ 10% of a typical mammalian genome due to their high copy numbers [3, 4]. Among the ~ 70 SINE families found in mammals [18], B1 is the most abundant in mouse [4] and possibly most rodent species [19]. B1s are derived from the RNA component of signal recognition particle 7SL RNA [20, 21] and share features with its ancestors. A functional B1 is ~ 150 bp long and transcribed by RNA polymerase III with the aid of its two transcription factor binding boxes [22, 23]. B1 sequences are rich in CpG sites, which are methylated and thus prone to mutation in mammalian genomes [24], and the elevated mutation rate is pronounced compared to the A-rich L1s [25, 26].,Both L1 and B1 have long histories of co-evolution with their host genomes. Unlike some LTR retrotransposons [27, 28], there is no known targeted mechanism for L1 excision and thus L1s persist in the genome unless they are removed by non-specific mechanisms. L1s can be found in all placental mammals and marsupials [2, 5, 29]. Mammalian L1s evolve as master lineages so that a single or a few lineages are responsible for the total retrotransposition in a short time window [30,31,32,33]. New master elements replace the old ones, eventually dominating retrotransposition, and this replacement process happens recurrently. B1s are younger than L1s, having arisen just before the divergence of the common ancestor of rodents, ~ 65 MYA [34], and they are specific to rodents. Other SINEs, including B2, B4 and ID elements, are also present in rodent genomes [19]. SINE families have been interacting with L1s for more than 100 MYA, and fossil remnants of extinct SINE families are detectable in well-characterized mammalian genomes [18, 35]. Despite being targeted by a slew of host restriction mechanisms, L1 and B1 compose approximately a quarter of a typical rodent genome [4, 7]. For example, in the mouse genome, there are ~ 599,000 total copies of L1, responsible for ~ 19% of the genome [4], of which ~ 3000 copies are potentially functional [36], and ~ 564,000 copies of B1, responsible for ~ 3% of the genome [4].,LINEs and SINEs have considerable impact on the mammalian genome, although they were traditionally viewed as “junk DNA”. As LINEs and SINEs, including L1s and B1s, retrotranspose and recombine, they introduce genome instability [37] and cause disease [38]. These elements may occasionally be co-opted by the host to serve host certain functions, such as their proposed roles in neuro-plasticity [39, 40], X chromosome inactivation [41, 42], regulatory functions [43, 44], and DNA break-repair [45]. Our current picture of the effects of retrotransposition does not take into account what effect silencing of LINEs and SINEs might have on these proposed functions.,Since L1 retrotransposition is under strict control by multiple host defenses [46], it might seem reasonable for the host to occasionally win the evolutionary arms race with L1s, resulting in loss of L1 activity (L1 extinction). Yet, L1 extinctions are relatively rare. Factors contributing to the rarity of L1 extinction could be but not limited to co-option of L1s for certain essential function to the host. Mammalian L1s are not known to move horizontally, although ancient L1s might have been able to do so given evidence of other non-LTR retrotransposons [47]. The unlikely replacement of L1s by horizontal movement would be evident as a mismatch between L1 phylogeny and host phylogeny. Therefore, mammalian L1 extinctions would affect all derived host species. Two factors are of note here. First, clades with early L1 extinctions could have given rise to large mammalian lineages without L1 activity and be easily detected because of both the number of species affected and the deterioration of the remnant sequences in the genome. Secondly, recent extinctions will be difficult to differentiate from periods of L1 quiescence. To clarify the terms related to loss of L1 activity in this work, we refer to a period of low L1 activity as “quiescence” and complete loss of L1 activity as “extinction”. Given the large phylogenetic impact of early extinctions, one might expect L1s to eventually become extinct in most mammalian genomes, and yet L1s have persisted throughout the entire evolutionary history of their placental mammal and marsupial hosts. Thus, either most L1 extinctions are either recent or rare, or mammalian lineages subject to ancient L1 extinctions do not persist or they give rise to few new species. Understanding the dynamics of L1 extinction will be as important as understanding the dynamics of L1 activity in sorting out the impact of L1s on mammalian genome evolution.,Several cases of L1 extinction have been proposed in the literature [48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56] and two of these are deep extinction events that cover major groups of mammals [50,51,52]. One of the major L1 extinctions occurred in a large group of South American rodents and includes most species in Sigmodontinae. Sigmodontinae is a subfamily of the Cricetidae family, including approximately 377 species classified into 74 genera in nine tribes (Fig. 1) [58] and thus contains 7–8% of the estimated 5000 mammalian species [59]. Given that B1 retrotransposition is dependent on that of L1, it is expected that B1s should lose their activity simultaneously with L1s. However, the B1 extinction in Sigmodontinae appears to have preceded that of L1s based on samples from 14 genera in five tribes [50,51,52], where the basal genus Sigmodon carries inactive B1 and active L1, and the descendant genera carry both inactive L1 and B1 (Fig. 1). It has also been shown that loss of L1 and B1 activity follows the expansion of a group of endogenous retroviruses [60, 61].,Phylogeny of the sigmodontine rodents. L1 and B1 activity displayed on the phylogeny shows that L1 extinction preceded that of B1. The phylogeny is based on Schenk et al. [57]. Taxa are the genera sampled; tribes are indicated on the right side of the taxa. Eight of the nine tribes and 12 of the 14 genera sampled by Rinehart et al. [52] are shown. L1 and B1 activity of each taxon is demonstrated by color: black, active L1 and B1; deep blue, active L1 and inactive B1; deep red, inactive L1 and inactive B1; light blue, L1 activity cannot be inferred; and, light red, L1 and B1 can be inferred to be inactive. “+” corresponds to active L1 and B1 and “o” corresponds to inactive L1 and B1,It was previously hypothesized that L1 can experience long-term quiescence as a “stealth driver” [62], and that B1 extinction could happen during this period of L1 quiescence [52]. Since B1s are more prone to mutations than the average sequence due to enriched CpG content [24], Rinehart et al. [52] hypothesized that B1 was unable to retrotranspose at a high enough rate during L1 quiescence to replace their active copies, accumulating debilitating mutations more rapidly than L1s. When a more active family of L1 emerged in the Sigmodontini, it was hypothesized that B1 was too degraded to retrotranspose, resulting in B1 extinction even in the presence of high L1 activity.,In this study, we investigate the evolution histories of L1 and B1 spanning the time of their extinctions and the radiation of the extant species in Sigmodontinae (Fig. 1). Since the group carrying extinct L1s and B1s (Oryzomyalia, Fig. 1) shares a common ancestor, we used the marsh rice rat Oryzomys palustris to represent this group, hereafter referred to as the “L1-extinct clade”. We used the hispid cotton rat Sigmodon hispidus to represent the clade carrying active L1 but inactive B1, hereafter referred to as the “basal group”. We used the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus to represent a closely related clade carrying both active L1 and B1, hereafter referred to as the “outgroup”.,Using unassembled genome sequences from the species representing the L1-extinct clade and the basal group, we show that the activity of L1 and B1 families preceeding the divergence of the clades is comparable in the current genomes of the two groups. L1 families had been steadily replaced before the split of the two groups and maintained activity after the split of the basal group and the L1-extinct clade. Shortly after this split L1 activity ceased in the L1-extinct clade but became highly active in the basal group. B1s, on the other hand, had a very large increase in activity prior to the split between the L1-extinct clade and the basal group, and there is no evidence of activity in the two groups following their divergence."

A lot of computational tools were developed to annotate them either in genomic assemblies or raw reads using de novo or homology-based approaches. But there has been no pipeline enabling users to get coding and flanking sequences of MGEs suitable for a downstream analysis from genome assemblies.,We developed a new pipeline, MGERT (Mobile Genetic Elements Retrieving Tool), that automates all the steps necessary to obtain protein-coding sequences of mobile genetic elements from genomic assemblies even if no previous knowledge on MGE content of a particular genome is available.,Using MGERT, researchers can easily find MGEs, their coding and flanking sequences in the genome of interest. Thus, this pipeline helps researchers to focus on the biological analysis of MGEs rather than excessive scripting and pipelining.,Eukaryotic genomes are mostly repetitive by nature. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), discovered by B. McClintock [1], constitute a major part of the repetitive fraction. Usually, MGEs are divided into two broad classes: Class I elements, or retrotransposons known to mobilize themselves through RNA intermediate and “copy-and-paste” mechanism; and Class II elements, or DNA transposons mostly mobilizing through “cut-and-paste” mechanism [2,3,4]. It is commonly accepted that retrotransposons or retroelements are represented by four classes (or orders): elements with long terminal repeats - LTR-retrotransposons, without terminal repeats - non-LTR-retrotransposons (including non-autonomous SINEs), Penelope-like elements (PLEs) and Tyrosine-recombinase retrotransposons (DIRS) [3]. Each class/order includes several superfamilies, e.g. L1, R2, R4, RTE, CR1, CRE, Jockey, Tx1, Rex, I, RandI, NeSL in non-LTR [2, 5], Penelope/Poseidon, Perere, Neptune, Coprina, Athena in PLE [6], DIRS, Ngaro and VIPER in DIRS [3]. Although this system is a subject of debate [7] and new discoveries like giant Terminons elements [8] may result in revising of the existing scheme, we will refer to this classification throughout this paper. Nowadays it is widely accepted that MGEs and particularly retrotransposons play a great role in genome plasticity and evolution [9,10,11,12,13,14]. Besides transposition machinery, they often encode diverse regulatory motifs (promoters, enhancers, regulatory RNAs) [15,16,17] and ribozymes [18] and may serve as recombination sites causing chromosomal rearrangements and structural variations as well as participate in creation of new genes and destruction of existing ones, and horizontal gene transfer [15, 19,20,21,22,23]. Modern hypotheses postulate that proliferation of MGEs in a genome occurs in response to drastic changes in environmental conditions thereby playing a role in speciation and adaptation [24, 25]. Additionally, it was demonstrated that abundances of genomic repeats contain phylogenetic signal [26].,But, despite MGEs importance, not so many researchers pay attention to the repetitive fraction [27] and this is - at least partially - caused by the lack of well-established tools/bioinformatic protocols for MGE search and analysis. Even eight years ago there was a “dense forest” of bioinformatics software [28] aimed to search for the repetitive fraction in genomic assemblies or raw reads, since then their amount increased that reflects constantly growing demands of the scientific community. All such tools could be divided into two categories according to the implemented approach: search by homology or de novo search. The software of the first type require a predefined library of repeats which is unavailable for most of the genomes. The typical and most widely used representative of this category is RepeatMasker [29], although it was designed to annotate and mask repetitive regions before the start of gene discovery. The other one - CENSOR [30] is used by RepBase - a curated database of repeats [31,32,33]. De novo approaches - as it could be inferred from its name - requires no previous knowledge of repeat content of the genome. Methods of this group are either structure based (i.e. use of specific structures like long terminal repeats of LTR-retrotransposons or TIRs and TSDs of MITE transposons), like LTRharvest [34], LTR_STRUC [35], LTRtype [36], MITE-Digger [37] and MITE-Hunter [38] or genome self-alignment based. This last group includes numerous tools, so we mention a few: RepeatGluer [39], RepeatFinder [40], PILER [41], RECON [42], RepeatScout [43], MGEScan [44], CARP [45], TEdenovo [46], Red [47]. PILER, RECON, RepeatGluer, RepeatFinder and RepeatScout were compared in [48] and it was shown that the best ones are RECON and RepeatScout, so their combination implemented in the package RepeatModeler [49] is still the most popular de novo repeat annotation package. Recent and more powerful tools (TEdenovo, as part of the REPET package, CARP and Red) unfortunately have their own shortcomings. The first one requires the installation of a massive set of packages on a distributed computer cluster which is not an easy task as well as a great amount of computational power required to perform the analysis. The second is not a tool per se right now, rather a collection of various programmes and libraries with a list of instructions attached. The latter of the three despite its speed and novel approach (machine learning algorithms) provides merely a list of repeats’ coordinates without any classification. Also, it is worth to mention a group of tools that use raw reads (either short or long) for de novo repeat discovery, thus being independent of assembly quality. These are RepLong, RepeatExplorer, ReAS, RepARK [50,51,52,53], but to date, their capabilities remain limited [54].,Thus, to obtain MGE’s sequences ready for phylogenetic analysis researchers have to be capable of using scripting languages and making pipelines manually to send an output of de novo programs to homology-based tools, validating found hits and retrieving coding sequences. That’s why we designed and developed a program called MGERT (Mobile Genetic Elements Retrieving Tool). Our program is actually a wrapper script that unifies several tools, hides technical quirks from a user and outputs ready-to-analyze individual copies of MGEs (either intact or disrupted) along with their flanking regions, genomic coordinates and descriptive statistics as well.,The basic plan of MGERT processing is as follows: a) de novo repeat annotation in a genome assembly using RepeatModeler; b) collecting consensuses of repeats specified by user; c) search for instances of these repeats in the assembly using RepeatMasker; d) retrieving of individual copies from the assembly using BEDTools [55]; r) search for ORFs with conserved domains using RPS-BLAST and CDD [56, 57]. One may start the pipeline from any of these steps (Fig. 1).,MGERT workflow chart. The genome assembly used as input for RepeatModeler for de novo search and classification of MGEs; their families that have been chosen by a user are pipelined to RepeatMasker for similarity search; these regions of similarity then being excised by BEDTools; conserved domain homology search by RPS-Blast followed by ORF extraction by ORFinder; adding flanking regions of specified length. Black outline of the input squares designates mandatory files; a black outline of output squares designates the output is used in the following step of the pipeline,First of all, one needs to set up the pipeline. It should be done in two consecutive steps. The first step: run the pipeline with the ‘--configure’ flag, what will result in a configuration file (in JSON format) where MGERT stores all the paths to executables, input and output files; if all the required tools are installed MGERT will find them automatically, else it will prompt user to enter valid paths manually. The second step: run the pipeline with ‘--make-cdd’ flag which will tell MGERT to prepare local RPS-BLAST database. To successfully complete this step the following conditions have to be satisfied: all the PSSM files (in SMP format) corresponding to particular domains of interest (i.e. RT or/and EN) have to be inside the working directory as well as comma- or TAB-separated table (with CSV extension) with domain - PSSM correspondence (see Additional file 1). This last table is needed to explicitly show MGERT which types of conserved domains should be validated in every single ORF. After this step new directory, “LocalCDD” will be created with all the necessary files inside, and the path to this directory will be added to the configuration file. After these preparation steps one can run MGERT specifying just two arguments: MGE type of interest (like LINE, PLE, BovB etc.) and name of the genome assembly (note, that MGE type should be specified according to names of the records in the FASTA file which might be checked using ‘--check-types’ flag). The pipeline will create a directory named after this assembly and all the output files will be saved into it.,MGERT pipeline uses the following algorithm and tools to collect user selected MGEs:,run the RepeatModeler pipeline and collecting MGE consensuses specified by the user (depends on RepeatModeler classification of de novo consensuses);,define the coordinates of regions similar to consensus sequences (by RepeatMasker);,merge of closely located regions in one single region; extraction of these regions (matches) to a FASTA file (using BEDTools), if the regions are located on minus strand, reverse-complement them;,search for conserved domains in the excised matches (by RPS-BLAST) with subsequent search for open reading frames containing CD-hit within (by both ORFinder and RPS-BLAST). By default ORFfinder uses standard genetic code table and reports ORFs of minimum length 1000 bp starting from ATG codon on a plus strand. Any of these parameters could be easily set using corresponding optional arguments;,add flanking regions of a specified length (default length is 0, i.e. add no flanks) (see Fig. 1),All these steps are automated by single python script MGERT.py. Thus, running a single script user can easily obtain genomic sequences derived from the chosen type of MGEs as well as interrupted and intact coding sequences of MGEs of interest.,MGERT takes as input either genome assembly only or genome asembly and one of the following five files: a) custom library of repeats (or consensuses) to find in an assembly; b) coordinates file, either in RepeatMasker or bed format; c) FASTA file of excised consensus’ matches; d) file with MGE’s open reading frames to filter it out or to add flanking regions.,These five input files might be used in five corresponding modes (specifying by the flag ‘--from-stage’):,default mode: a user has only the genome assembly and starts from de novo search of MGEs of interest (with all the following steps);,consensus mode: a user already has de novo library of all MGEs and wants to run the remaining steps of the pipeline or to chose other MGE family for analysis;,coordinates mode: a user already has a coordinates table of MGE’s similarity regions and wants to (re) run the analysis with different excision settings;,orfs mode: a user already has excised MGEs matches and wants to (re) run the ORFs and CD search with different settings;,flanks mode: run to add flanking regions of another length to the ORFs.,Besides the standard output files of underlying tools MGERT produces the following files:,MGE consensuses of interest (MGE_consensi.fa);,unclassified consensuses to be sent to the CENSOR web site (Unknown_consensi.fa.classified);,BED file with coordinates of matches (genome.out.bed);,FASTA file of merged and excised matches (MGE_excised_matchesX.fa, where X stands for value of --merge option);,Files with descriptive statistics and histograms of lengths of all output sequence datasets (Additional files 2, 3 and 4) (.stats and .png files);,FASTA file of matches with CD hits (MGE_matches_with_hits_eX.fa, where X stands for e-value);,FASTA file with coding sequences of a specified length (MGE_cdsX.fa, where X stands for CDS minimum length);,FASTA file with coding sequences containing conserved domains (MGE_cdsX_with_domains_eX.fa, where X stands for CDS minimum length and e-value, respectively);,FASTA file with the same sequences but with flanks added (MGE_cdsX_with_domains_eX_extended_LXRX.fa, where X stands for CDS minimum length, e-value, length of left (L) and right (R) flanking regions, respectively).,One can start the analysis from any of the steps described above, this is regulated by the use of the option ‘--from-stage’ with one of the four keywords (consensus, coords, orfs or flanks) corresponding to the analysis steps from 2nd to 5th. In a case when a researcher already has a library of MGE consensus (possibly obtained from another de novo repeat prediction tool) or simply run MGERT one more time to retrieve another family of repeats, one should use the option ‘--from-stage consensus’ and (optionally) specify the consensus file after the option ‘--lib’. One should run the pipeline from stage 3 (option ‘--from-stage coords’) if one wants to change the minimum distance between matches to be merged into a single entry (it is regulated with the ‘--merge’ option). Running the pipeline from steps 4 and 5 (keywords orfs and flanks) can be done to change the minimum length of an ORF (along with the genetic code, start codon, strand and expectation value) and flanking regions correspondingly. Also, it is possible to specify at which step the pipeline should stop using an option ‘--to-stage’. It can be useful e.g. when one wants to run RepeatModeler only and inspect the results then.,Also, the pipeline allows a researcher to use CENSOR classification results to increase the yield of the MGEs of interest. The RepeatModeler outputs many unclassified consensuses (marked as ‘unknown’ in FASTA header) which one may send to the web-version of CENSOR - a repeat classification and masking tool developed and hosted (along with RepBase database) by the GIRI Institute. In such a case a researcher has to use the option ‘--censor’ providing either URL or path to HTML file with classification results to be parsed by MGERT."

                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0159-2,RetrotransposonLINE-1L1ORF1p,"Long Interspersed Element 1 (LINE-1) is a retrotransposon that is present in 500,000 copies in the human genome. Along with Alu and SVA elements, these three retrotransposons account for more than a third of the human genome sequence. These mobile elements are able to copy themselves within the genome via an RNA intermediate, a process that can promote genome instability. LINE-1 encodes two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p. Association of ORF1p, ORF2p and a full-length L1 mRNA in a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle, L1 RNP, is required for L1 retrotransposition. Previous studies have suggested that fusion of a tag to L1 proteins can interfere with L1 retrotransposition.,Using antibodies detecting untagged human ORF1p, western blot analysis and manipulation of ORF1 sequence and length, we have identified a set of charged amino acids in the C-terminal region of ORF1p that are important in determining its subcellular localization. Mutation of 7 non-identical lysine residues is sufficient to make the resulting ORF1p to be predominantly cytoplasmic, demonstrating intrinsic redundancy of this requirement. These residues are also necessary for ORF1p to retain its association with KPNA2 nuclear pore protein. We demonstrate that this interaction is significantly reduced by RNase treatment. Using co-IP, we have also determined that human ORF1p associates with all members of the KPNA subfamily.,The prediction of NLS sequences suggested that specific sequences within ORF1p could be responsible for its subcellular localization by interacting with nuclear binding proteins. We have found that multiple charged amino acids in the C-terminus of ORF1p are involved in ORF1 subcellular localization and interaction with KPNA2 nuclear pore protein. Our data demonstrate that different amino acids can be mutated to have the same phenotypic effect on ORF1p subcellular localization, demonstrating that the net number of charged residues or protein structure, rather than their specific location, is important for the ORF1p nuclear localization. We also identified that human ORF1p interacts with all members of the KPNA family of proteins and that multiple KPNA family genes are expressed in human cell lines.,Long interspersed element 1 (L1) is a non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon that accounts for approximately 21% of the human genome [1]. L1 has colonized the genome for millions of years via an autonomous copy-and-paste mechanism [2]. L1 is also responsible for the mobilization of non-autonomous retrotransposons such as Alu and SVA elements [3]. Although L1 has been found in an evolutionarily diverse range of species, its proteins show conservation of specific functional domains and residues [4]. While the majority of L1 insertions are severely 5′ truncated, an estimated 80–100 L1 elements per genome are full-length, thus still capable of independent retrotransposition [5].,The full length L1 is a 6 kb retrotransposon that consists of a 5’UTR, ORF1, ORF2, and a 3′ UTR [6]. The 5′ UTR includes an internal polII promoter and the 3′ UTR contains a terminal poly-a sequence [7, 8]. ORF1 encodes ORF1 protein (ORF1p), a homotrimeric protein with nucleic acid chaperone activities [9, 10]. ORF2 encodes ORF2 protein (ORF2p), which contains reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities necessary for insertion of the element [11, 12].,ORF1p and ORF2p interact with their own mRNA in cis to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle in the cytoplasm [6, 13,14,15]. This acts as a likely intermediate for retrotransposition. How the L1 RNP accesses genomic DNA is poorly understood. Published work supports the possibility of both passive and active nuclear transport mechanisms [16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. Once access to the genomic DNA is gained, ORF2p functions to copy the L1 mRNA for integration into a new location in the host genome, a process termed target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) [23, 24].,Recent research has indicated that retrotransposition events can promote genomic instability relevant to cancer origin and/or progression [25,26,27]. Global L1 DNA hypomethylation, along with a corresponding increase in L1 expression, has been reported in many cancer types as compared to benign tissue [28,29,30,31,32]. An increase in overall ORF1p expression has been detected in a wide variety of patient tumor types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma [33], Barrett’s esophagus [34], and others [35,36,37]. Nuclear ORF1p, specifically, is seen to correlate with poor prognostic outcomes in breast cancer patients [38, 39]. Consistent with in vivo findings, in vitro studies have shown that overexpressed untagged ORF1p localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm in human cell lines [40,41,42,43,44].,ORF1p is a 338 amino acid protein that is necessary for L1 retrotransposition [13, 45]. It contains four domains (Fig. 1a). The N-terminal domain (NTD, AAs 1–54) is intrinsically disordered and has a putative role in RNA binding [9]. It also contains two conserved residues, phosphorylation of which is necessary for retrotransposition in cultured cells [46]. The coiled coil domain (CCD, AAs 55–157) contains 14 heptad repeats that facilitate ORF1p trimerization [9, 47]. The RNA recognition motif (RRM, AAs 157–255) and the C-terminal Domain (CTD, AAs 256–338) bind directly to RNA [9]. ORF1p binds both DNA and RNA in a nonsequence-specific manner, showing a preference for single stranded over double stranded nucleic acids [48, 49]. ORF1p also has chaperone activities involving melting, annealing, and strand exchange of nucleic acids [50, 51]. After translation, ORF1p trimers bind to their parental mRNA [6], potentially providing stability to the RNP as it continues through the retrotransposition process. Each ORF1p trimer occupies approximately 50 nucleotides during RNP formation [52], indicating that ORF1p could be abundant in RNP complexes. Purification of L1 RNPs confirmed higher content of ORF1p compared to the amount of ORF2p [22]. Although there is a strong cis preference for L1 proteins to associate with their nascent mRNA to form RNPs [15], ORF1p is also used in trans during SVA mobilization [53] and has been shown to improve Alu retrotransposition [54]. In vitro and cell culture-based analyses have shown that ORF1p molecules made from different mRNAs can associate in trans and that certain C-terminally truncated ORF1p constructs can suppress L1 retrotransposition in vitro [41]. Conserved groups of amino acids in the CTD have been previously shown to be necessary for L1 retrotransposition, as mutation of these amino acids into alanine reduces L1 retrotransposition to < 1% of wild type [9, 11, 55].,Truncated ORF1 proteins require the RRM domain for their nuclear localization. a (top) ORF1 domains are indicated as an N-terminal domain (N), a coiled-coil domain (CCD), and RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). Positions of domains shown are approximate. The antibody symbols (name above) denote approximate location of antibodies on the ORF1p.

GAPDH (cytoplasmic marker) and Lamin A/C (nuclear marker) are used as loading and cell fractionation controls. Positions of molecular markers are indicated on the right in kDa. Control indicates cells transfected with empty plasmid,Subcellular localization of L1 proteins during the L1 replication cycle or non-specific ORF1p complexes present during ectopic expression of ORF1p is poorly understood as conflicting results regarding the requirement of cellular division for L1 retrotransposition have been reported [16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. Recent studies indicate that L1 may access the nucleus passively during breakdown of the nuclear membrane [16]. However, reports that L1 retrotransposition occurs in nondividing cells support the potential role of active transport for L1 and ORF1p, which is often used as a proxy for L1 RNPs [17, 18]. This is further supported by the findings that L1 ORF1p associates with nuclear pore proteins [19, 22, 56] and by the recent finding that ORF1p nuclear localization is not affected by cell cycle arrest [44]. Recent findings show the existence of distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic RNP complexes with ORF1p-rich RNPs being found predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction. However, previous studies in HeLa cells show that overexpression of flag-tagged ORF2p is only detected in the nucleus when co-expressed with ORF1p, indicating a role for ORF1p on L1 RNP subcellular localization [57]. Studies done in 143B TK-cells, however, only show a slight increase in nuclear flag-tagged ORF2p when co-expressed with ORF1p [58]. Thus, it remains unclear whether active nuclear import of ORF1p (and possibly, by extension, the L1 RNP) occurs during retrotransposition and whether cell-type specific differences in regards to ORF1p localization exist. Therefore, determining requirements for subcellular localization of L1 proteins remains an unresolved, but important, problem because of its clinical significance and relevance to basic L1 (and its parasites - SINEs and SVA elements) biology.,Although the presence of a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the human ORF1p has not been documented, ORF1p in a non-LTR retrotransposon, SART1 from Bombyx mori, contains a NLS required for the nuclear import of its RNP [59]. A putative NLS was predicted in the human L1 ORF2p, but mutagenesis studies of this motif have shown no significant effect on localization of the ORF2p fragments containing this sequence [60] A nucleolar localization signal (NoLS), however, has been identified in ORF2p [58]. Mass spectrometry analysis of flag-tagged human ORF1p identified association with nuclear pore proteins KPNA2 and KPNB1 in HEK293T cells [56], suggesting that this protein contains a functional NLS. KPNA2 typically binds to a protein’s NLS and serves as an adaptor for KPNB1 association, which provides the import activity of the complex [61, 62]. Multiple classes of NLSs have been identified. Canonical (or classical) NLSs are specific sequences that bind to KPNA family of proteins. These NLSs can be mono- or bipartite [63]. Bipartite NLSs are typically comprised of two imperfect monopartite NLSs separated by 10–12 amino acids [61]. KPNA family proteins have both major and minor binding grooves. Monopartite NLSs bind to just one of the two grooves. Bipartite NLSs bind to both grooves [63]. Another class are noncanonical NLSs that, instead of being specific sequences, are composed of charged, basic amino acids (typically arginines or lysines) that bind to the nuclear pore proteins. All noncanonical NLSs bind to only the minor binding groove of KPNA [64, 65]. Several NLS prediction programs have been developed using yeast and/or human proteins and various algorithms to identify putative NLSs [66,67,68]. While the previously published mass spectrometry analysis strongly supports the association of ORF1p with the nuclear import complex [56], the sequence requirements within ORF1p that facilitate this association remain unknown.,Many experimental studies of ORF1p localization have previously relied on the use of tags for detection [40, 41, 56, 57, 69, 70] because, in the past, it was the only approach available at the time. GFP-tagged ORF1p is detected primarily in the cytoplasm by IHC, and subcellular localization of this tagged protein has been shown to be affected by truncations of ORF1p [69]. However, the GFP-tag has since been shown in some instances to interfere with authentic subcellular localization of ORF1p and other proteins (Author’s response of [16]) [71]. ,Using ORF1p-specific antibodies, more recent publications reported direct detection of untagged human (transiently expressed or endogenous) ORF1p providing more biologically relevant findings for the purposes of localization studies [39,40,41, 44, 70, 72].,Here, using untagged human ORF1p, western blot approach, and cultured human cells, we demonstrate that the RRM domain of ORF1p is a crucial determinant for the nuclear localization of the full-length and truncated human ORF1 proteins. We utilized mutation and deletion analyses to identify specific amino acids that are necessary for ORF1p nuclear localization and association with the KPNA family of nuclear pore proteins. Using co-IP approach, we demonstrate that human ORF1p associates with all members of the KPNA family tested in this study. These findings support the presence of a noncanonical NLS and redundancy in the ORF1p interaction with the nuclear pore machinery."

ERVs were classified into 18 families and found two most “modern” subfamilies in the pig genome. The transposition activity of pig L1 was verified by experiment, the sense and antisense promoter activities of young L1 5′UTRs and ERV LTRs and expression profiles of young retrotransposons in multiple tissues and cell lines were also validated. Furthermore, retrotransposons had an extensive impact on lncRNA and protein coding genes at both the genomic and transcriptomic levels. Most protein coding and lncRNA (> 80%) genes contained retrotransposon insertions, and about half of protein coding genes (44.30%) and one-fourth (24.13%) of lncRNA genes contained the youngest retrotransposon insertions. Nearly half of protein coding genes (43.78%) could generate chimeric transcripts with retrotransposons. Significant distribution bias of retrotransposon composition, location, and orientation in lncRNA and protein coding genes, and their transcripts, were observed.,In the current study, we characterized the classification and evolution profile of retrotransposons in pigs, experimentally proved the transposition activity of the young pig L1 subfamily, characterized the sense and antisense expression profiles and promoter activities of young retrotransposons, and investigated their impact on lncRNA and protein coding genes by defining the mobilome landscapes at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. These findings help provide a better understanding of retrotransposon evolution in mammal and their impact on the genome and transcriptome.,Transposable elements (TEs), also referred to as the mobilome, are DNA sequences that have the ability to integrate into the genome at a new site within their cell of origin. They can be divided into retrotransposons and DNA transposons based on their diverse structures and transposition mechanisms. Retrotransposons consists of short interspersed elements (SINEs), long interspersed elements (LINEs), and long terminal repeats (LTRs), including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), all of which propagate by the reverse transcription (RT) of an RNA intermediate [1, 2]. TEs were once viewed merely as junk DNA and selfish DNA parasites. However, genome-scale studies over the past several decades have shown that TEs and their recognizable remnants span both prokaryote and eukaryote organisms, are major determinants of genome sizes [3,4,5], and account for about half of the human genome [6]; they even make up 85% of the maize genome [7]. TEs have shaped both genes and the entire genome and play a key role in genome function, speciation, and diversity [8, 9]. TEs also contribute substantially to the evolution of the genome at the DNA level, and they can undergo “molecular domestication” [10, 11]; at least 50 genes have been domesticated from mobile elements in the human genome [12]. Chimeric transcripts between TEs and protein coding genes tend to be common [13, 14]. TE insertions can also induce diverse structural variations of the genome [9, 15]. Furthermore, TEs contribute substantially to the evolution of many genes at the transcriptional level by acting as alternative promoters, enhancers, splice sites, or polyadenylation signals [16, 17], or the transcription factor binding sites for these genes [18]. It has also been suggested that a majority of primate-specific regulatory sequences are derived from TEs [19]. The epigenetic landscape can be altered by TE insertions [20]. Evolution of the sperm methylome of primates is associated with Alu and SVA retrotransposon insertions [21]. Methylation levels of retrotransposons are associated with carcinogenesis and metastasis [22,23,24]. In addition, growing evidence shows a close association of TEs with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and a significant number of small ncRNAs originate from TEs [25]. Furthermore, TEs tend to enrich in the lncRNAs of human, mice, and zebrafish [26, 27], and retrotransposons make a strong contribution to lncRNA evolution, structure, and function in mammalian organisms [28].,Retrotransposons occupy one-third to half of the mammal genomes, which are dominated by LINEs and SINEs, followed by LTR retrotransposons [8]. The LINE family is the most successful TE family in both the common ancestors and extant species of mammals, and account for 20.42% in humans, 19.20% in mice, 19.54% in pigs, 21.21% in platypuses, and 28.60% in tammars, while SINEs, known as the partner of LINEs that require LINEs for their transposition, account for 13.14% in humans, 8.22% in mice, 13.08% in pigs, 21.53% in platypuses, and 11.70% in tammars. LTRs are the third major type of interspersed repeats in mammals, accounting for 8.29% in humans, 9.87% in mice, 4.48% in pigs, 0.12% in platypuses, and 3.90% in tammars [6, 29,30,31,32]. In addition, unusual evolution dynamics of L1 s in mammals are observed, with a single family of replicative dominant subfamilies evolved in one period, then being replaced by a more recently evolved family [33]. Studies in humans and mice also revealed the diversification evolution of L1 s, and the coexistence of multiple L1 subfamilies with different promoters in young and ancient families [34,35,36]. Little is known about the factors that determine the burst and decline of SINEs, but, clearly, SINE amplification is dependent on LINE activity, and activity correlation is observed for many SINE/LINE partners; for example, mammalian-wide interspersed repeat (MIR) (Ther-1) and L2 in humans and mice [6, 29], MEG and L1 in fruit bats [37, 38], and Alu and L1 subfamilies in humans [39]. Although most retrotransposons are no longer active in mammals, research has shown that most mammal genomes contain at least one family of actively accumulating retrotransposons [8, 40]. Examples include L1/LINEs in most mammals [41], RTE/LINEs in ruminants and marsupials [42], with the exception of LINEs in the megabat family, where the activity of L1 went extinct 24 million years ago [43], while ERVs/LTR in rodent genomes are believed to be active [29, 44]. The retrotransposition activities of L1 s and SINEs in humans and mice, including human L1 (L1HS), mouse L1 (TF and GF), and both human SINE (AluYa5/8 and AluYb8/9) and mouse SINE (SINE B1 and SINE B2), have been verified experimentally [41].,Despite the prevalence of retrotransposons in mammalian genomes and their biological relevance, relatively few pig retrotransposons have been reported. Initially, the TE coverages in Duroc and Wuzhishan pig genomes have been well annotated in previous studies [30, 45]. The divergence distribution and phylogenetic analysis of retrotransposons in pigs revealed that the main repeating element groups are LINEs and SINEs, and only a single family of each is deduced to be putatively active [30, 45], and two complete pig ERVs were identified in Wuzhishan pig genome, which may carry the risk of pathogen transmission to human in xenotransplantation [45]. Whereas the overall activity, diversity, and evolution of retrotransposons, particularly the diversity at the family, and subfamily levels, and the evolution dynamics of the dominate L1, SINE, and ERV families, in the pig genome remain largely unknown. In addition, retrotransposon involvement in the structural and functional evolution of genes and genomes, as well as their impact on the transcriptome in pig, remain completely unknown.,In this study, we performed de novo detection of retrotransposons in pigs using multiple pipelines. We characterized the classification of LINEs, SINEs, and ERVs at the family and subfamily levels, highlighted the evolution dynamics of these families and subfamilies, and then determined the retrotransposition activity of L1 and the sense and antisense promoter activities and expression profiles of young retrotransposon subfamilies. Furthermore, we investigated the intersection between retrotransposons and host genes, including protein-encoding and lncRNA genes, as well as the impact of retrotransposons on the transcriptome. Overall, this study revealed the retrotransposon landscape and their evolution profiles in the pig genome, domesticated the retrotransposition activities of young L1 subfamilies, and defined the sense and antisense expression profiles and promoter activities of young retrotransposon subfamilies. Our data support the hypothesis that most copies of retrotransposons are fossils in the pig genome, but a few retrotransposon copies of L1 s, SINEs, and ERVs may still be active. Our analysis also reveals that the majority of protein coding and lncRNA genes contain retrotransposon insertions, and retrotransposons tend to be enriched in lncRNA, with nearly half of protein coding genes generating chimeric transcripts with retrotransposons."

Beyond the well-known conjugative plasmids, recent genome analyses have shown that integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are the most widespread conjugative elements, even if their transfer mechanism has been little studied until now. The initiator of conjugation is the relaxase, a protein catalyzing a site-specific nick on the origin of transfer (oriT) of the ICE. Besides canonical relaxases, recent studies revealed non-canonical ones, such as relaxases of the MOBT family that are related to rolling-circle replication proteins of the Rep_trans family. MOBT relaxases are encoded by ICEs of the ICESt3/ICEBs1/Tn916 superfamily, a superfamily widespread in Firmicutes, and frequently conferring antibiotic resistance.,Here, we present the first biochemical and structural characterization of a MOBT relaxase: the RelSt3 relaxase encoded by ICESt3 from Streptococcus thermophilus. We identified the oriT region of ICESt3 and demonstrated that RelSt3 is required for its conjugative transfer. The purified RelSt3 protein is a stable dimer that provides a Mn2+-dependent single-stranded endonuclease activity. Sequence comparisons of MOBT relaxases led to the identification of MOBT conserved motifs. These motifs, together with the construction of a 3D model of the relaxase domain of RelSt3, allowed us to determine conserved residues of the RelSt3 active site. The involvement of these residues in DNA nicking activity was demonstrated by targeted mutagenesis.,All together, this work argues in favor of MOBT being a full family of non-canonical relaxases. The biochemical and structural characterization of a MOBT member provides new insights on the molecular mechanism of conjugative transfer mediated by ICEs in Gram-positive bacteria. This could be a first step towards conceiving rational strategies to control gene transfer in these bacteria.,Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) drives the evolution of bacterial genomes and plays an important role in the adaptation of bacteria to different environments or the colonization of novel niches. Conjugative elements are major actors that trigger HGT [1, 2]. Besides conjugative plasmids, many integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) in the host chromosome encode their own DNA transfer from donor to recipient cells by conjugation [3,4,5]. Genome analyses indicate that ICEs are widespread in most phyla of bacteria, and that many of them carry adaptive genes such as antibiotic resistance or virulence genes [3, 4, 6, 7], hence contributing to the dissemination of these traits among bacterial populations. Thus, many Firmicutes have recently become resistant to antibiotics through ICE transfer, including various strains of Clostridia, Enterococci, Staphylococci and Streptococci, some of which are severe human or zoonotic pathogens [8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. Although Gram-positive ICEs are more abundant than conjugative plasmids, especially in Firmicutes genomes [7], their molecular mechanism is still poorly characterized. A recent analysis of 124 completely sequenced streptococcal genomes identified 3 major superfamilies of ICEs in streptococci, the most widespread of which being the ICESt3/ICEBs1/Tn916 superfamily [15]. As Tn916 and its relatives have been involved in the spread of various antimicrobial resistance genes, especially resistance to tetracyclines and macrolides [6, 14, 16], the molecular characterization of the conjugation machinery from ICESt3/ICEBs1/Tn916 superfamily is critical.,Prior to transfer, ICEs excise from the host chromosome as a circular form. As in conjugative plasmids, the initiation of conjugative transfer is likely performed by a multi-protein complex called the relaxosome, that recognizes the origin of transfer (oriT) on the excised ICE DNA to be transferred [17]. As demonstrated for conjugative plasmids, the main protein of the relaxosome is the relaxase, a trans-esterase enzyme encoded by ICEs. The relaxase introduces a single-stranded nick at the nic site of oriT. Whereas the 3′-end of the nick is used to initiate rolling-circle replication of the element, the relaxase remains covalently bound to the 5′-end via a catalytic tyrosine residue [18]. A coupling protein is assumed to recruit the relaxase-DNA complex to a type-IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded by the ICE, providing energy to translocate this complex into the recipient cell [19]. The relaxase is then thought to join the transferred ssDNA at the nic site, leading to a re-circularization of the ssDNA in the recipient cell [20].,Relaxases, also termed Mob (for mobilization) proteins, belong to different families of proteins. The canonical relaxases harbor a histidine triad with a ‘HxH’ signature that is known to coordinate a metallic cofactor [21]. They include the MOBF, MOBP, MOBL, MOBQ, MOBV and MOBB families [7, 18, 22, 23]. This ‘HxH’ motif is also found in rolling-circle replication initiators of numerous plasmids and viruses, usually termed Rep proteins [24]. Several other families of relaxases have been identified which do not harbor the ‘HxH’ signature and which are unrelated to canonical relaxases [23]. The best described are the MOBH family related to HD-hydrolases [23, 25], and the MOBC family of relaxases that has no typical relaxase motif, but surprisingly has been shown to be related to restriction endonucleases [26]. Additionally, recent observations indicate that several other protein families also function as relaxases, especially in Firmicutes. This is the case of the TcpM protein from the pCW3 conjugative plasmid (Clostridium perfringens) that is related to tyrosine recombinases [27]. Furthermore, rolling circle replication (RCR) initiators of the Rep_1 family have been found to act as a relaxase, being responsible for the mobilization of plasmids by ICEs, in addition to their role in plasmid maintenance [28].,The ICESt3/ICEBs1/Tn916 superfamily of ICEs, which is widespread in Firmicutes, also encodes non-canonical relaxases. These relaxases were unclassified by Garcillan-Barcia et al [23], but were grouped in a family called MOBT in 2011 [7]. Interestingly, putative MOBT relaxases have also been detected in a number of putative integrated and mobilizable elements (IMEs) in streptococcal genomes [29, 30]. Up to now, the activity of only two MOBT relaxases has been demonstrated, namely those encoded by Tn916 (Orf20) and ICEBs1 (NicK). The Orf20 protein was reported to involve the Tn916 integrase for DNA sequence specificity [31]. However, this result needs to be confirmed because the Orf20 version used lacked the N-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain due to misidentification of the start codon [32]. The NicK relaxase has been shown to be essential for conjugation and the nic site within ICEBs1 oriT was identified [33]. Up to now, no MOBT relaxase has been characterized biochemically or structurally.,MOBT relaxases are non-canonical relaxases that harbor a PF02486 domain. This domain is also found within Rolling Circle Replication (RCR) initiator proteins of the Rep_trans family which are involved in the maintenance of many small Firmicutes plasmids [34]. A structural and biochemical characterization of the active site of the Rep_trans RCR initiator protein encoded by the pSTK1 plasmid (Geobacillus stearothermophilus) has been performed recently [34].,From a structural point of view, 3D structures are available for three canonical relaxase families: MOBF [23, 35,36,37], MOBQ [23, 38], and MOBV [39]. To date, no 3D structure is known for the non-canonical relaxases (MOBH, MOBC, and MOBT).,In this work, we characterized the MOBT relaxase encoded by ICESt3, hereafter called RelSt3. RelSt3 appeared to be essential for ICESt3 conjugation, and we determined experimentally the oriT sequence. The RelSt3 protein was shown to be dimeric and to exhibit the expected relaxation activity that is dependent on a metallic cation, preferentially Mn2+. We also investigated the phylogenetic relationships between MOBT and Rep_trans proteins, and we propose a 3D model of RelSt3 by homology with the RepSTK1 structure. Critical residues conserved within Rep_trans proteins were mutagenized in RelSt3, and we demonstrated their involvement in RelSt3 activity. Our results constitute the first biochemical characterization of a MOBT relaxase."

However, the effects of retrotransposition on the host genes remain incompletely known.,We report here that insertion of a chimeric L1 (cL1), but not IAP solo LTR, into intron 6 of Axin1 using CRIPSR/Cas9 induced the kinky tail phenotype with ~ 80% penetrance in heterozygous AxincL1 mice. Both penetrant (with kinky tails) and silent (without kinky tails) AxincL1 mice, regardless of sex, could transmit the phenotype to subsequent generations with similar penetrance (~ 80%). Further analyses revealed that a longer Axin1 transcript isoform containing partial cL1-targeted intron was present in penetrant, but absent in silent and wild type mice, and the production of this unique Axin1 transcript appeared to correlate with altered levels of an activating histone modification, H3K9ac.,The mechanism for AxincL1 mice is different from those previously identified in mice with spontaneous retrotransposition of IAP, e.g., AxinFu and Avy, both of which have been associated with DNA methylation changes. Our data suggest that Axin1 locus is sensitive to genetic and epigenetic alteration by retrotransposons and thus, ideally suited for studying the effects of new retrotransposition events on target gene function in mice.,Transposable elements (TEs) make up > 50% of the human genome [1]. The vast majority of human TEs are retrotransposons, which replicate via a RNA-based process termed retrotransposition [2]. Based on sequence organization, retrotransposons are further classified into LTR (long terminal repeat) and non-LTR retrotransposons. LTR retrotransposons are also called endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which display ongoing insertional activities in mice but not in humans [3]. Among them, mammalian apparent LTR retrotransposon (MaLR) elements are the most abundant in both human and mouse genomes although they are no longer replicating [3,4,5,6]. On the other hand, IAP (intracisternal A-type particle) is one of a few LTR retrotransposon families that remain active in the mouse genome [3,4,5,6]. Non-LTR retrotransposons include long interspersed elements (LINEs) and short interspersed elements (SINEs). LINE-1 (L1) sequences are abundant (~ 17% of the human genome) and have been identified as the only active and autonomous mobile element in the human genome [2, 3]. L1 consists of four components: a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) that serves as a promoter, a 3′ UTR containing a polyadenylation signal, an ORF1 (open reading frame 1) encoding an RNA binding protein with nucleic acid chaperone activity, and a conserved ORF2 protein that harbors reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities [2]. In addition to self-mobilization, L1 proteins can also copy other RNAs into a new locus via several distinct pathways. SINEs, such as human Alu and SVA (SINE-VNTR-Alu) elements, hijack the L1 retrotransposition machinery and have successfully proliferated in the human genome [7,8,9]. Although not as efficient, non-TE transcripts can also be copied, forming processed pseudogenes [10, 11]. The sequence downstream to a full-length L1 can be mobilized to new locations via 3′ transduction [12,13,14,15]. Indeed, a study of 244 cancer patients has revealed that almost 25% of patients have 3′ transductions of L1 sequence [16]. Chimeric or hybrid sequences can be generated when L1 reverse transcriptase switches templates [17,18,19]. The vast majority of TEs in the genome are truncated or rearranged, leaving behind 3′ fragments of L1 s or single (“solo”) LTRs of ERVs, in which ORFs critical for TE replication are lacking [2, 3, 20, 21]. Moreover, most of the TE insertions described to date in cancers are intronic or intergenic [22, 23]. It remains to be investigated the extent to which TE insertions affect the expression of their host coding genes and genomic activities near the insertion sites.,It is difficult to study retrotransposition and its effects on gene expression because retrotransposon sequences are widespread in the genome and often integral parts of the introns of coding genes [22]. One approach is to follow the fate of de novo insertions that are launched from engineered donor L1 transgenes. In this regard, several cell and mouse models have been generated to study the effects of L1 retrotransposition by tagging human or mouse L1 s with intron-disrupted retrotransposition reporters [24,25,26,27,28,29]. This approach has indeed provided important insights into L1 retrotransposition activities in various cell lines and tissues [26,27,28,29,30,31]. In several cell types (e.g. mouse embryonic stem cells, rat neuronal progenitor cells, human embryonic carcinoma and other cancer derived cell lines), the newly integrated L1 s are efficiently silenced by epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, histone deacetylation or H3K9me3 (H3 Lys9 trimethylation) [26,27,28,29]. In mouse models, when propagated through the germline, the retrotransposed sequences exert a graded influence on the flanking genomic sequences at the level of DNA methylation, creating “sloping shores” around the hypomethylated CpG island in germ cells [32]. A limitation of this approach is that both the site and the length of insertions are unpredictable. So it is impossible to compare the effect of different retrotransposon sequences on flanking genes. A complementary approach is to study the effect of spontaneous insertional mutagenesis by endogenous retrotransposition events in mice [33] and in humans [34]. However, these insertions are fixed, some insertions of retrotransposons in these loci may have no discernable phenotype, and therefore, the effects of these insertions remain to be elucidated. We sought to find some DNA loci that could result in discernable phenotypes to study the effects of L1 retrotransposition. Interestingly, two of most studied mouse models involve spontaneous LTR retrotransposon (e.g. IAP) insertions. The first is AxinFu(AxinFused) mice, in which a 5.1-kb IAP retrotransposon is inserted in antisense orientation into intron 6 of Axin1, causing a kinky tail phenotype [35]. The second case is Avy (agouti viable yellow) mice, which show variable yellow agouti coat color phenotypes and is, similar to AxinFu, caused by a 5.1-kb IAP insertion in antisense orientation into the pseudoexon 1A of agouti (A) locus [36]. In both cases, DNA methylation levels of the IAP retrotransposon appear to inversely correlate with the severity of the phenotype. Additionally, both the DNA methylation patterns and phenotypes can be transmitted to subsequent generations in a metastable manner [37,38,39,40]. To study the effects of retrotransposed sequences, we attempted to generate mutant mice carrying either a shorter version of IAP LTR (e.g., a solo LTR) or a chimeric L1 (cL1) at the same sites in Axin1 and A (agouti) loci using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology [41,42,43]. Surprisingly, we failed to recapitulate the phenotypes when the solo LTR of IAP was inserted into the same two loci as those in the AxinFu and Avy mice. Of interest, we did observe kinky tail phenotype when the cL1 was inserted into intron 6 of Axin1 (termed AxincL1). Moreover, we found that the molecular mechanisms underlying the kinky tail phenotype were different between AxincL1 and AxinFu mice."

However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that some TEs exhibit regulatory activities in a range of biological pathways and diseases, with notable examples in bile metabolism and innate immunity. TEs are typically suppressed by epigenetic modifications in healthy somatic tissues, which prevents both undesirable effects of insertional mutagenesis, and also unwanted gene activation. Interestingly, TEs are widely reported to be dysregulated in epithelial cancers, and while much attention has been paid to their effects on genome instability, relatively little has been reported on their effects on gene regulation. Here, we investigated the contribution of TEs to the transcriptional regulation in breast cancer cell lines.,We found that a subset of TE subfamilies were enriched in oncogenic transcription factor binding sites and also harboured histone marks associated with active transcription, raising the possibility of these subfamilies playing a broad role in breast cancer transcriptional regulation. To directly assess promoter activity in triple negative breast cancer cell lines, we identified four breast cancer-associated genes with putative TE-derived promoters. TE deletion confirmed a contribution to promoter activity in all cases, and for two examples the promoter activity was almost completely contained within the TE.,Our findings demonstrate that TEs provide abundant oncogenic transcription factor binding sites in breast cancer and that individual TEs contain substantial promoter activity. Our findings provide further evidence for transcriptional regulation of human genes through TE exaptation by demonstrating the regulatory potential of TEs in multiple breast cancer cell lines.,Transposable elements (TE), or transposons, are repetitive genetic elements that are ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes [1, 2]. When first discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock in the mid-1940s, TEs were proposed to be “controlling elements” capable of regulating gene activity [3, 4]. McClintock’s theory was initially dismissed, and the prevailing view was that TEs were “junk” or “selfish” DNA sequences with no apparent regulatory roles [5,6,7]. However, in more recent years, McClintock’s theory of TEs as gene expression regulators has been revised and refined by emerging evidence showing that they do indeed play a role in modulating and reshaping host transcriptional regulatory networks [8,9,10,11]. In fact, the regulatory roles of TEs are not rare events exclusive to plants, but are common to almost all eukaryotic evolutionary lineages, including humans [12,13,14].,The regulatory activity of TEs is derived from the cis-regulatory elements within their sequences, which include internal promoters and binding sites that can be recognised by host transcription factors (TF) and RNA polymerases (RNA Pol) [2, 8, 10, 15,16,17]. For example, LTR retrotransposons, which originated from retroviral infections that successfully integrated into the host germline, originally contained an RNA Pol II promoter in each of their long terminal repeats (LTR) [2]. This compatibility is essential for the transcription of TEs, and allows them to exploit host machinery to aid their proliferation in the host genome [2]. While TEs directly benefit from host compatibility, the host also stands to benefit through exaptation of TE sequences to modify or create transcriptional networks for the regulation of host genes. During the course of evolution, many TEs remaining in the human genome have been exapted to contribute promoters or enhancers of human genes [9, 15, 18, 19]. In this study, we focus specifically on the promoter activity of TEs in the human genome.,Human TEs harbour a substantial number of TF binding sites (TFBS). On average, TEs are estimated to contain ~ 19% of the total TFBSs within the human genome [8]. These binding sites are recognised by a diverse group of TFs, differing greatly in their biological functions. Amongst these are components of the basic transcription machinery, such as the TATA box binding protein (TBP), as well as factors involved in the remodelling of chromatin states, such as the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) and CHD2 [8]. In addition, some pathway-specific TFs have also been demonstrated to rely on TEs for their binding sites. A recent example is the interferon regulatory factor (IRF), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) TFs involved in the innate immunity [10].,Furthermore, an early study by Jordan et al. shows that 25% of the > 2000 human promoters documented in The Human Promoter Database contain TE-derived DNA sequences [15]. This finding is supported by recent advances in the Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) technology, which maps genome-wide transcription start sites (TSS) by identifying mRNA 5′ end clusters [20]. A defining feature of promoters is the presence of transcription initiation sites, and CAGE data demonstrate that approximately 24% of TSSs (defined by the presence of two or more CAGE tags) are located within TEs [18]. Several studies have identified individual TEs with promoter functions in the genome. One example is MER11A, an ancient LTR acting as the primary promoter to BAAT, which encodes an enzyme involved in bile metabolism [21, 22]. Further examples are antisense L1 and Alu elements that together contribute the sole apparent promoters to HYAL-4 and FUT5, which are involved in hyaluronan catabolism and cell adhesion respectively [9]. These examples demonstrate the presence of TE-derived promoter activity in a diverse range of biological pathways.,While these cis-regulatory sequences have endowed TEs with the potential to regulate human gene expression, the transcriptional activity of the majority of TEs are suppressed heavily in somatic tissues [23, 24]. This is hypothesised to be a defence mechanism by the host genome, which protects the host from large mutations resulting from active TE mobilisation, as well as abnormal gene expression driven by TE-derived promoters and enhancers [23,24,25]. The human genome employs an array of mechanisms to defend against TE activation, and the most relevant to transcriptional repression are DNA methylation and histone tail modifications [25,26,27].,Increased DNA methylation is often associated with gene silencing, and most TEs are heavily suppressed by DNA methylation and thus rendered inactive in somatic tissues [27,28,29]. Unlike DNA methylation, the relationship between human TEs and histone modifications is highly complex and less well-understood. Kondo and Issa first showed the recruitment of repressive H3K9 methylation to Alu elements in the human genome [26]. However, a study by Huda et al. on CD4+ T cells shows that Alu and L2 elements are enriched in active marks, while L1 and LTR TEs are depleted for active marks, and/or enriched for repressive marks [25]. On the other hand, TEs which are exapted to perform regulatory functions are often associated with active histone marks, resembling those typically associated with active regulatory regions [10, 30].,However, the suppressive regulations over TEs, such as DNA methylation, are often alleviated in some disease states, and the transcriptional activation of TEs is commonly observed in tumours [28, 31, 32]. The oncogenic capacity of TE-derived transcriptional regulation is summarised with specific examples in recent reviews [32, 33]. For example, TE-derived promoters have been documented to lead to oncogene activation, followed by neoplastic transformation and disease progression in some types of cancer, such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma, bladder tumours and diffuse large B cell lymphoma [34,35,36]. However, the involvement of TE-derived promoters in other cancer types remains largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to address this gap in knowledge by investigating the activity of TE-derived promoters in breast cancer cell lines. More specifically, we focussed on the highly malignant triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype, which lacks the expression or amplification of hormone receptors, and is thus refractory to targeted therapies [37,38,39,40].,In this study, we aimed to investigate the transcriptional activity of TEs in breast cancer, particularly their interactions between TFs and contribution to promoter activity, using breast cancer cell lines as a model. We analysed genome-wide binding sites for three breast cancer-associated TFs (C/EBPβ, E2F1 and MYC) in MCF7 cells, and confirmed that a substantial fraction of these TFBSs resided in TEs. We showed that these TFBSs were distributed across a diverse range of TEs, and identified enriched TE subfamilies with a potentially important role in modulating breast cancer transcription. We found that the binding of breast cancer-associated TFs to TEs was correlated with active histone modifications, further supporting the transcriptional activity of these TEs. We subsequently identified individual TEs within the promoters of breast cancer-associated genes and confirmed that TEs located upstream of SYT1, UCA1, AK4 and PSAT1 contributed promoter activity in TNBC cell lines."

This major contribution of TEs to the mutational landscape in mouse contrasts with the situation in human, where their relative contribution as germ line insertional mutagens is much lower. In this focussed review, we provide comprehensive lists of TE-induced mouse mutations, discuss the different TE types involved in these insertional mutations and elaborate on particularly interesting cases. We also discuss differences and similarities between the mutational role of TEs in mice and humans.,The mouse and human genomes harbor similar types of TEs that have been discussed in many reviews, to which we refer the reader for more in depth and general information [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. In general, both human and mouse contain ancient families of DNA transposons, none currently active, which comprise 1–3% of these genomes as well as many families or groups of retrotransposons, which have caused all the TE insertional mutations in these species. As in humans [4], the mouse genome contains active retrotransposon families of long and short interspersed repeats (LINEs and SINEs) that can cause germ line mutations via new insertions but, in contrast to humans, the mouse also contains several groups of retrotranspositionally active endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) that are responsible for most reported insertional mutations.,ERVs are the result of retroviral infections or retrotranspositions in the germline. The general structure of an ERV is analogous to that of an integrated provirus, with flanking long terminal repeats (LTRs) containing the transcriptional regulatory signals, specifically enhancer, promoter and polyadenylation motifs and often a splice donor site [10, 11]. Sequences of full-length ERVs can encode gag, pol and sometimes env, although groups of LTR retrotransposons with little or no retroviral homology also exist [6,7,8,9]. While not the subject of this review, ERV LTRs can often act as cellular enhancers or promoters, creating chimeric transcripts with genes, and have been implicated in other regulatory functions [11,12,13]. The mouse genome contains many different groups of ERVs and related LTR retrotransposons that together comprise ~ 10% of the sequenced genome [1] and which have been characterized to varying extents [6, 9, 14, 15]. ERVs in mouse and other vertebrates are generally categorized into three classes. Class I ERVs are most related to the exogenous gamma-retroviral genus, Class II to beta- and alpha-retroviruses and Class III to spuma-retroviruses [6, 9]. The very large non-autonomous MaLR (mammalian apparent LTR retrotransposon) group is also considered Class III but has only very small traces of retroviral homology. Different mammals have distinct collections of ERVs and the mouse is unusual in having a much higher fraction of Class II elements compared to humans or other mammals [1, 6]. For all but very young groups, the majority of ERV loci exist only as solitary LTRs, the product of recombination between the 5′ and 3′ LTRs of integrated proviral forms [16, 17]. Moreover, for ERVs that have not undergone this recombination event, most have lost coding competence due to mutational degradation over time.,Unlike human ERVs that are likely no longer capable of autonomous retrotransposition [18, 19], some mouse ERVs are retrotranspositionally active and are significant ongoing genomic mutagens in inbred strains, causing 10–12% of all published germ line mutations via new integration events [1, 20]. The large Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) ERV group is responsible for close to half the reported mutations due to new ERV insertions, with the Early Transposon (ETn)/MusD ERV group also contributing substantially [20](Fig. 1a). These groups and other mutation-causing ERVs will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent relevant sections. The majority of mutagenic ERV insertions occur in introns and disrupt normal transcript processing (e.g. splicing and polyadenylation) to varying degrees, a mechanism well recognized since the 1990s [21,22,23,24,25] and discussed further below.,Distribution of mouse mutations caused by TE insertions. a Numbers of published mutations caused by different TE types. b Strain bias for IAP and ETn/MusD insertional mutations. c Upper panel – proportion of LINE1 insertional mutations that are full length or near full length. Lower panel shows high proportion of B2 SINEs among insertional mutations,LINE-1s (L1s) are autonomous non-LTR elements that have accumulated to as many as 500,000 copies in both mouse and human genomes using a copy-and-paste mechanism of amplification [1,2,3, 26]. Full length L1s are 6–7 kb and contain two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding ORF1p and ORF2p, with the latter having endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity [27,28,29,30]. The number of potentially active L1s (i.e. full-length elements containing intact ORFs) varies significantly between human and mouse. Bioinformatics analyses of the reference genomes have documented 2811 mouse and 146 human L1s that are fully structurally intact [31]. Functional studies have estimated numbers of active L1s to be ~ 3000 for mouse [32] and 80–100 for human [33]. In contrast to the human genome that has had a single subfamily of LINEs active at any given evolutionary time, the mouse genome contains three concurrently active L1 subfamilies (T(F), A, and G(F)) [32, 34] that are insertionally polymorphic among strains [17, 35]. One of the distinguishing features of these subfamilies is the differing 5′ monomer tandem repeats which, when combined with a downstream non-monomeric sequence, form their 5′ UTRs [36]. The 5′ UTR also contains the L1 pol II promoter, which occurs downstream of the transcriptional start site [37, 38], an arrangement common to non-LTR retrotransposons [39], allowing the promoter to be retained in the L1 mRNA.,Mouse and human L1s contain promoters, splice and polyadenylation signals in both sense and antisense directions that are utilized during L1 and host gene transcription, also sometimes leading to the formation of chimeric mRNAs [40,41,42,43,44]. As with ERVs [20, 45], such cis-acting sequences are a likely reason for the negative impact of some intronic L1 insertions on gene expression [43]. De novo L1 inserts can vary in size from just a few bases to those containing a full-length L1 sequence [26], with the vast majority of such inserts being 5′-truncated to varying extents. Although the exact mechanisms underlying this truncation phenomenon remain unclear, there is a positive correlation between the frequency of retrotransposition and insert length [46], and cellular DNA repair interference with L1 integration may play a role [47, 48].,Sporadically, new germ line L1 insertions cause mutations when they land in or near a gene in human [4] or mouse (discussed below), and somatic insertions can also occur, although few of the latter have been shown to exert a significant biological effect [49,50,51]. Mutagenic L1 inserts can potentially disrupt normal gene function or expression by interfering with it directly or by introducing deletions or complex genomic rearrangements that are sometimes associated with the integration process [3, 52]. In addition to introducing de novo insertions containing L1 sequences, L1 can mobilize flanking genomic sequences as well. This occurs as a result of their incorporation into the nascent L1 mRNA generated by either inaccurate/upstream transcriptional initiation (5′ transduction) or inefficient transcriptional termination at the L1 3′ polyadenylation site resulting in readthrough and 3′ transduction [3, 53, 54]. Recent analysis of endogenous L1 expression in human cell lines determined that only about a third of expressed L1 loci generate such readthrough transcripts [55] but a similar analysis has not been performed for mouse. The uniqueness of these transduced sequences are often useful in identifying the source L1 element responsible for a newly retrotransposed copy [56].,SINE elements are non-autonomous retrotransposons, as they do not encode proteins involved in their amplification. As with human Alu SINE sequences [57], mouse SINEs have been shown to be retrotransposed by mouse L1 [58]. Only one of the two L1 proteins (ORF2p) is sufficient to drive Alu SINE mobilization in tissue culture [57], although ORF1p enhances the process [59]. Both mouse and human L1s can efficiently mobilize their non-orthologous SINEs, suggesting that such a symbiotic relationship has evolved multiple times [58,59,60,61,62]. There are several SINE classes in the mouse genome that together comprise ~ 8% of the genome [1]. Among these are B1, B2, B4/RSINE, ID, and MIR. New mutagenic insertions have been documented for B1 and B2 (see below), indicating that at least some copies are still potentially active. B1 (like human Alu) is derived from 7SL RNA, and B2 is derived from tRNA [3]. B1 and B2 SINEs are both present at very high genomic copy numbers: ~ 560,000 for B1 and ~ 350,000 for B2 [1]. Like mouse L1s and ERVs, these mouse SINEs are insertionally polymorphic in inbred strains [17, 63, 64].,We assembled lists of mutations caused by TEs by perusing the literature and by querying the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database of mutant alleles [65]. In October 2018 we obtained lists from MGI of all spontaneous mutant alleles that listed “viral”, “transposon” or “insertion” as the cause and extracted all relevant cases through manual curation. To avoid ascertainment bias, we excluded cases where investigators were specifically screening for effects of insertionally polymorphic TEs [35, 66, 67]. While such cases can show effects on gene expression, observable phenotypes due to these insertionally polymorphic TE insertions were not reported in the aforementioned studies. In addition, we excluded cases where the insertion event likely occurred in cultured ES cells used to produce transgenic mice. Nearly all arose spontaneously but two cases of mutations occurring during a chemical mutagenesis experiment, but likely not caused by the chemical mutagen, were also included. This search resulted in a total of 115 TE insertion mutations. Ninety-four of these were caused by insertions of ERVs/LTR retroelements and 21 were L1 or L1-mediated (Fig. 1). In the case of the ERV mutations, the tables shown here are updates of previously published lists [1, 20, 68].,The group of ERVs responsible for the most reported mutations are the IAP elements. IAP sequences are Class II elements and are highly abundant in the mouse [6, 69]. Different estimates for IAP copy number exist in the literature but a recent analysis of all sequences annotated “IAP” by Repeatmasker [70] found ~ 3000 solitary LTRs and ~ 2800 full-length or partial full-length elements in the reference C57BL/6 genome [71]. Of the latter, ~ 1000 have 5′ and 3′ LTRs that are 100% identical, indicative of a very young age, and most of these belong to the IAPLTR1 or 1a subtypes [71]. As expected for such a young ERV group, IAP elements are highly insertionally polymorphic among inbred mouse strains [17, 66, 67, 72]. Although ~ 200 IAP sequences (IAPE elements) contain an env gene [73], most do not. Loss of env and other specific genetic modifications facilitated adoption of an intracellular retrotranspositional life cycle by IAPs [74] resulting in their accumulation to high copy numbers as genomic “super spreaders” [75]. Besides the lack of env, there are a few common partly deleted proviral forms [69] with the most notable being the 1Δ1 subtype, which has a 1.9 kb deletion removing part of gag and pol, resulting in an ORF encoding a novel gag-pol fusion protein. Although retrotransposition of 1Δ1 proviruses is non-autonomous, requiring gag and pol proteins in trans from other IAPs [76], this subtype is responsible for the great majority of new IAP insertion mutations [20]. Interestingly, it has been shown that the gag-pol fusion protein functions in cis to facilitate retrotransposition [77]. Together with a generally higher level of 1Δ1 transcripts compared to full length IAP mRNAs (see below), this cis effect could explain why most new insertions are of the 1Δ1 subtype.,Although transgenic experiments have shown expression of an IAP LTR only in the male germ line [78], endogenous IAP transcription is also detectable in embryogenesis as early as the two cell stage and appears highest in the morula and blastocyst stages [79]. Moreover, at least some IAP elements can be transcribed in normal somatic tissues, particularly in the thymus, where a specific subtype of IAP LTR shows transcriptional activity [80, 81]. Notably, the levels of 1Δ1 5.4 kb IAP transcripts are comparable or often more abundant than full-length IAP transcripts in different tissues or cell types [69, 80, 82], although the former are present in lower copy numbers [69, 71, 83]. The molecular mechanisms underlying the generally higher transcript levels of 1Δ1 elements are unknown but one possibility is that these elements are more likely to escape the general epigenetic transcriptional repression of IAPs by DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications [84,85,86,87].,Table 1 lists mouse germ line mutations caused by insertions of IAPs. Somatic insertions of IAP elements can also occur and cause oncogene or cytokine gene activation in mouse plasmocytomas, myelomas and lymphomas [88,89,90], likely due to the fact that some IAP LTRs are transcriptionally active in lymphoid tissues [80, 81]. Most of the germ line insertions occur in gene introns and disrupt transcript processing, notably splicing and polyadenylation (Table 1) [20]. However, several IAP-induced mutations involve ectopic gene transcription promoted by an upstream or intronic inserted LTR that is regulated by DNA methylation [20, 91]. In these cases, the IAP is oriented in the opposite transcriptional direction with respect to the gene and it is an antisense promoter within the LTR that is responsible for the ectopic gene transcription. For a number of such cases, including the most well studied Avy allele of agouti [92], variable establishment of epigenetic repressive marks on the IAP LTR result in variable expressivity of the mutant (IAP) allele in genetically identical mice and have been termed metastable epialleles [91, 93]. Interestingly, a recent genome-wide screen for other IAP metastable epialleles in C57BL/6 mice identified ~ 100 such loci, with an enrichment of flanking CTCF binding sites as the primary distinguishing feature [94].,Because high numbers of IAP mutations in C3H mice and high IAP insertional polymorphisms among C3H substrains have been noted before [20, 83], we investigated the strain of origin for all TE-induced mutations. For IAPs, the strain of origin could not be ascertained for three of the 46 cases but, of the remaining 43, a remarkable 84% (36 cases) occurred in a C3H strain or hybrid involving C3H (Table 1, Fig. 1b). This marked skew is not seen for mutations caused by any other retroelements, indicating that ascertainment bias cannot explain the high frequency of IAP-caused mutations in C3H mice. While the date of the mutation is difficult to determine in some cases, IAP retrotranspositions in C3H mice have spanned several decades, with the earliest reported cases in the 1950s and the latest in 2014 (Table 1). This indicates that the unusual IAP activity has been a characteristic of C3H strains for at least 60 years. Indeed, Frankel et al. have shown that at least 26 1Δ1 IAP insertions present in C3H/HeJ are absent from the highly related C3HeB/FeJ substrain [83], again indicative of ongoing activity of IAPs, particularly the 1Δ1 subtype, in this strain.,Although reasons for the numerous IAP insertional mutations in C3H strains are unknown, it is noteworthy that normal spleen, bone marrow and thymus from C3H/He mice have much higher levels of IAP transcripts compared to C57BL/6 and STS/A mice [95], suggesting that transcriptional deregulation may be involved. As well, IAPs are transcriptionally upregulated in radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia in C3H/He mice, resulting in new insertions in the leukemic cells, most of which are of the 1Δ1 subtype [95, 96]. These observations, coupled with the fact that most new mutations in C3H mice involve the 1Δ1 subtype suggests that this IAP subtype is accumulating in the C3H genome at a faster rate than full length elements.,Two recent reports illustrate the prudence of considering IAP induced mutations whenever working with C3H mice (Fig. 2). In the first case, Frankel et al. found that an IAP insertion in the Pcnx2 gene in C3H/HeJ mice (Pcnx2C3H/HeJ) reduces expression of this gene, which in turn mitigates the effect of an IAP insertion in Gria4 (Gria4spkw1) which causes seizures [83]. Hence one IAP insertion modifies the effect of another (Fig. 2a). In another intriguing example, Barau et al. conducted a screen in C3HeB/FeJ mice using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis to identify genes involved in retrotransposon silencing in the germ line [97]. They identified several lines with the same mutation, indicating it was not induced by ENU but rather was spontaneous. This mutation was an IAP element inserted in an intron of a gene, annotated as a non-functional pseudogene, that formed as a tandem duplication of Dnmt3B. Barau et al. showed that this gene, now termed Dnmt3C, is indeed a functional DNA methyltransferase responsible for methylating promoters of young retroelements, including L1 elements and IAPs, in the male germ line [97]. Therefore, an IAP insertion facilitated the discovery of a gene involved in its own silencing (Fig. 2b).,Effects of IAP insertions in C3H mice. a An IAP insertion in Gria4 in C3H/HeJ causes seizures associated with spike-wave discharges but seizure episodes are much more frequent when the allele is crossed into another strain. The modifying effect in C3H/HeJ is due to another IAP insertion in Pcnx2, which reduces the detrimental effect of the Gria4 mutation. b A new IAP insertion in the previously unknown Dnmt3c gene was detected in a C3HeB/FeJ colony during a screen for genes involved in retrotransposon silencing in the male germ line. See text for references. Black boxes are gene exons and green arrows and lines represent IAP LTRs and internal sequences. Numbers of exons/introns and distances are not to scale,The C3H strain was derived by Leonard Strong from a 1920 cross of a Bagg albino female (ancestors to the BALB/c strain) and a male from Little’s strain of “dilute browns” (ancestors to the DBA strain) [98]. One of the original female progeny of this mating developed spontaneous mammary tumors and this trait was selected for or against by subsequent inbreeding to develop the C3H strain (highly susceptible to mammary tumors) and the CBA strain (highly resistant). Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), the transmissible agent responsible for the early onset mammary tumors in C3H [99, 100], was later purged from most C3H related strains by pup fostering or re-derivation. In particular, the most widely used C3H substrain C3H/HeJ was re-derived to be MMTV-free at the Jackson Laboratory (JAX) in 1999 and all C3H substrains carried at JAX have been free of MMTV since that time. Because IAP mutations have continued to occur in C3H/HeJ mice after removal of MMTV (Table 1), it is unlikely that activities of the two retroviral entities are directly related. Various substrains of C3H, including the commonly used C3H/HeJ, were derived in the late 1940s and early 1950s [101].,Interestingly, there is some evidence that C3H/HeJ has a higher spontaneous mutation rate than most other strains. A multi-year study conducted at JAX from 1963 to 1969 examined over 7 million mice derived from 28 inbred strains for spontaneous observable and heritable mutations [102]. C3H/HeJ had marginally the highest overall rate of mutations but not remarkably so [102]. However, this study also documented mutational cases of “irregular inheritance” where the trait was heritable but showed very poor penetrance. Of the 35 examples of such cases, 16 (46%) arose in C3H/HeJ, even though this strain accounted for only 9.7% of the 7 million mice in the study [102]. It is tempting to speculate that at least some of these unusual cases may involve a new IAP insertion behaving as a metastable epiallele [91, 93].,After IAPs, the ETn/MusD group is responsible for the next highest number of germ line mutations, with 31 cases (Fig. 1, Table 2). ETn elements were first described as repetitive sequences expressed highly in early embryogenesis [103]. Subsequent expression analyses showed that ETns are transcribed in two windows of embryonic development. First during E3.5–7.5 in the inner cell mass and epiblast and second between E8.5–11.5 in various tissues including the neural tube, olfactory/nasal processes and limb buds [103,104,105]. Although ETns have LTRs, they have no coding capacity and, hence, their mode of retrotransposition was initially a mystery. Based on traces of retroviral homology in canonical ETns, we identified an ERV group, termed MusD, which is the likely progenitor of ETn [106, 107] and Ribet et al. demonstrated that coding competent MusD elements provide the machinery necessary for ETn elements to retrotranspose [108]. A subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the large betaretrovirus genus classified MusD as belonging to the Class II ERV-β7 group [14]. One analysis of copy numbers of ETn and MusD in C57BL/6 found ~ 240 ETn elements, ~ 100 MusDs and ~ 550 solitary LTRs [107], and they are highly insertionally polymorphic [17, 66, 109]. As for IAP elements, loss of the env gene and other genetic modifications likely resulted in genomic amplification of MusD (and ETn) elements as intracellular retrotransposons [110]. In another similarity to IAPs, most germ line mutations caused by ETn/MusD are due to insertions of the non-autonomous ETn (Table 2), in particular a specific subtype ETnII-β [20]. Of the 31 cases, only three are documented to be MusD while the rest are ETn (Table 2). The reasons for this are not clear but ETn transcripts are much more abundant than MusD transcripts in embryos and ES cells [107, 111] and there is evidence that MusD is subject to greater levels of epigenetic suppression [111, 112].,ETn/MusD mutations do not show an extreme strain bias as observed for IAP insertions. However, eight mutations have occurred in “A” strain mice (Fig. 1b), such as A/J, and two in the seldom used strain SELH/Bc (Table 2) which has a high incidence of exencephaly [113, 114]. Interestingly, genomic copy number estimates in different mouse strains revealed that, while there are no detectable differences in MusD numbers, A/J, SELH/Bc and CD-1 mice have two to three times more ETnII-β elements compared to C57BL/6 [107]. Transcript levels of MusD and ETnII-β in day 7.5 embryos are also higher in SELH/Bc and CD-1 compared to C57BL/6 [107].,Nearly all of the ETn mutagenic insertions occur in gene introns, in the same transcriptional direction as the gene, and disrupt normal transcript processing through utilization of canonical or cryptic signals within the ETn, notably a specific strong splice acceptor site in the LTR, coupled with either a downstream splice donor or polyadenylation signal [20, 45]. This extreme orientation bias for mutagenic insertions is also observed for the intronic IAP insertions that do not involve IAP promoter activity (Table 1). Such an orientation skew for detrimental insertions is indeed expected, given that fixed/older ERVs have an antisense bias in genes [115, 116], presumably reflecting the fact that such insertions are less likely to be potentially deleterious and selected against.,In an attempt to mechanistically understand these orientation biases, we modeled splicing events involving intronic ERVs (using computationally predicted splice and polyadenylation motifs) and surprisingly found similar predicted frequencies of alternate splicing caused by sense or antisense ERVs [45]. However, actual splicing patterns of human mRNAs with intronic ERVs suggests that suppression of splicing within antisense-oriented ERVs occurs, possibly via steric hindrance due to annealing of sense-oriented ERV mRNAs [45]. This scenario would be analogous to gene therapy approaches where oligonucleotides that anneal to and suppress the use of mutagenic splice sites are used to redirect splicing and restore gene function [117]. Although unproven, such a mechanism could contribute to the general antisense bias for neutral/fixed ERV insertions and the opposite bias for mutagenic insertions.,Unlike for IAPs, there are no documented cases of ETn promoters causing a phenotype by driving ectopic gene expression (Table 2). This is likely due at least in part to the fact that ETn/MusD LTRs are normally only transcriptionally active in embryogenesis, responding to embryonic transcription factors [118, 119], so their promoter/enhancer activity would be silent in somatic tissues where most observable but non-lethal phenotypes manifest themselves. There is, however, at least one case where enhancer effects of an ETn insertion are likely responsible for a mutant phenotype. In this example, an ETn insertion downstream of the Dusp9 gene upregulates this gene and also causes malformations in Polypodia mice, although a direct link between Dusp9 deregulation and malformations has not been shown [120].,There is an intriguing but complex story involving two of the three documented MusD insertions [121,122,123]. Both of these cause the dactylaplasia (Dac) embryonic limb malformation phenotype by insertions within (Fbxw4Dac-2J) or upstream (Fbxw4Dac) of the Fbxw4 gene. Both are full length MusD elements that share 99.6% identity and have occurred in different mouse strains. In the former case (Fbxw4Dac-2J), the intronic, sense oriented MusD severely reduces the amount of normal Fbxw4 transcripts, likely via typical transcript processing disruption or via physical disruption of a conserved, and hence potentially regulatory, ~ 1.5 kb region within the intron [123], although neither mechanism has been formally demonstrated. In the other Dac mutation (Fbxw4Dac, also termed Dac1J) the MusD is inserted 10 kb upstream of the Fbxw4 gene in antisense orientation. However, no effects on the size or abundance of Fbxw4 transcripts are evident in mice carrying this insertion, so the mechanism by which it causes dactylaplasia remains unclear [121,122,123].,Interestingly, the Dac phenotype is modified by an unlinked polymorphic locus mdac (modifier of dactylaplasia) [124]. In strains homozygous for the mdac allele (eg. BALB/c and A/J), the dactylaplasia phenotype is observed if the mice carry either dac mutation. However, in strains carrying the other allele Mdac (eg. CBA, C3H or C57BL), the phenotypic effects of the dac mutations are not observed [122, 124]. Although the identity of mdac is still unknown, it could be a gene involved in epigenetic regulation of MusD. In mdac/mdac mice, the 5′ LTR of the Dac1J MusD element is unmethylated and enriched in active histone marks whereas this LTR is heavily methylated and enriched in repressive histone marks in mice carrying the Mdac allele [122]. Moreover, ectopic MusD transcript expression is observed in embryos and limb buds of dactylaplasia mdac/mdac mice, but not in wildtype mdac/mdac mice, suggesting that the increased MusD expression is due to transcription of the Dac1J MusD element itself, rather than general upregulation of MusDs in the genome [122]. The mdac locus has been mapped to a 9.4 Mb region between markers D13Mit310 and D13Mit113 on chromosome 13 [122, 124]. Interestingly, this region includes a cluster of KRAB-ZFP (zinc finger protein) transcription factor genes. KRAB-ZFP genes are found in multiple clusters in the genome, are rapidly evolving and highly polymorphic in mice [125, 126] and some are involved in epigenetic silencing of ERVs [126]. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the identity of mdac is such a gene.,The murine leukemia virus (MLV or MuLV) group is the most well characterized ERV group in the mouse and has caused seven documented spontaneous mutations (Fig. 1a,Table 3). MLV is also likely responsible for retrotransposing the non-autonomous VL30 ERV involved in the non-agouti mutation that will be discussed in the next section. MLVs are Class I elements, belonging to the gamma retrovirus genus, entered the mouse genome less that 1.5 million years ago and still contains infectious members [127]. MLV loci are highly insertionally polymorphic among strains [128, 129] with copy numbers of ~ 20 for xenotropic MLV and ~ 40 for polytropic MLV [9]. Ecotropic copies, i.e. those able to infect only mouse cells (and not those of other species) based on env protein recognition of a cellular receptor, are present in very few copies in various strains [127]. New germ line insertions appear to occur primarily through oocyte reinfection, rather than intracellular retrotransposition [130], which has likely kept MLV copy numbers low. Ever since it was first reported that exogenous MLV can integrate into the germ line [131], MLV and MLV-based vectors have been widely used for many applications including insertional mutagenesis screens, gene therapy and oncogene discovery [132,133,134].,All of the MLV mutation-causing insertions occur in gene introns and affect normal gene transcript processing to varying degrees (Table 3). The very first ERV-induced mutation to be described, over 35 years ago, was an MLV insertion causing the dilute coat color mutation (Myo5ad) in DBA/2J mice [135]. This mutation can revert due to homologous recombination between the 5′ and 3′ LTR of the full length provirus, leaving a solitary LTR at the locus [136]. Phenotypic reversion by this mechanism also occurs for the hairless mutation (Hrhr), another of the first documented cases caused by an MLV insertion [137].,In addition to the ERVs discussed above, members of five other ERV groups have caused mouse mutations (Table 4). Like the IAP and ETn/MusD groups, two of the groups, ERV-β2 and ERV-β4, belong to Class II or the betaretrovirus genus as defined by pol homology [14]. Both of these groups are heterogeneous and relatively low in copy number. The ERV-β2 group includes mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) but the ERVs responsible for the four cases of mutations belong to a different ERV-β2 cluster which has internal sequences annotated in Repbase [138] primarily as “ETnERV3” with LTRs annotated as “RLTR13A” [14]. The full ERV was not sequenced for the Nox3het mutation but we presume it to be an ERV-β2 since the limited LTR sequence provided matched RLTR13A or RLTR13B [139]. For the other three ERV-β2 cases in Table 4, their full sequences have been published and they are 96–99% identical to each other with the major differences being internal deletions in the Agtpbp1pcd-2J and Prph2Rd2 elements with respect to the longer Etn2Sd ERV insertion (D. Mager, unpublished observations).,The above cases highlight the continual difficulties and confusion with ERV annotation. As an example, the ERV insertion causing the allele termed “Etn2Sd”, where the ERV likely acts as an enhancer, was reported to be an “ETn” element [140,141,142]. However, as discussed above, this is misleading since “ETnERV3” is a separate entity compared to the more well-known ETn/MusD group, an important distinction but likely generally overlooked. Interestingly, when the reference C57Bl/6 genome was analyzed in 2004, less than 15 ERV loci falling into the ERV-β2 group were found and none were fully coding competent [14]. Moreover, all of the ERV-β2s discussed above also lack full open reading frames. Nonetheless, the presence of these elements at sites of new mutations in other strains suggests such strains have or had coding-competent members to provide proteins in trans, allowing retrotransposition of defective elements. The strains in which the ERV-β2 mutations arose (Table 4) do not share close relationships so the origin of any active autonomous copies is unknown.,The ERV-β4 group [14] has been involved in two known mutations and both occurred in old “fancy mice” (Table 4). One of these mutations (Ednrbs) was caused by insertion of a 5 kb non-coding competent element whose internal sequence is classified as “ERV-β4_1B-I "

                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0156-5,RetrotransposonL1Md monomerClassificationAnnotation,"L1Md retrotransposons are the most abundant and active transposable elements in the mouse genome. The promoters of many L1Md retrotransposons are composed of tandem repeats called monomers. The number of monomers varies between retrotransposon copies, thus making it difficult to annotate L1Md promoters. Duplication of monomers contributes to the maintenance of L1Md promoters during truncation-prone retrotranspositions, but the associated mechanism remains unclear. Since the current classification of monomers is based on limited data, a comprehensive monomer annotation is needed for supporting functional studies of L1Md promoters genome-wide.,We developed a pipeline for de novo monomer detection and classification. Identified monomers are further classified into subtypes based on their sequence profiles. We applied this pipeline to genome assemblies of various rodent species. A major monomer subtype of the lab mouse was also found in other Mus species, implying that such subtype has emerged in the common ancestor of involved species. We also characterized the positioning pattern of monomer subtypes within individual promoters. Our analyses indicate that the subtype composition of an L1Md promoter can be used to infer its transcriptional activity during male germ cell development.,We identified subtypes for all monomer types using comprehensive data, greatly expanding the spectrum of monomer variants. The analysis of monomer subtype positioning provides evidence supporting both previously proposed models of L1Md promoter expansion. The transcription silencing of L1Md promoters differs between promoter types, which supports a model involving distinct suppressive pathways rather than a universal mechanism for retrotransposon repression in gametogenesis.,Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is a major type of autonomous retrotransposons that is commonly found in all mammalian genomes [1]. L1 elements act as parasitic retro-elements in the host genome via a copy-and-paste mechanism to increase their copy numbers in the genome [2, 3]. They comprise about 17% of the human genome and 19% of the mouse genome [4, 5]. A typical full-length L1 element is about 6–7 kb long, containing a 5’ untranslated region (UTR), two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) and a 3’ UTR [6–9]. The 5’ UTR harbors transcription factor binding sites and serves as an internal promoter for transcription by RNA polymerase II [10]. Families of L1 found specifically in the mouse genome are named after the species name of the lab mouse Mus domesticus: the L1Md families [11]. A special tandem repeat structure has been found in L1Md 5’ UTRs, with each repeating sequence called a monomer [12, 13]. So far such tandem repeat structure has also been observed in other genomes, but only those in the mouse genome are located close to the 5’-end of L1 elements, and the number of monomers per retrotransposn is much higher in mouse [14]. The tandem repeat structure is thus a special feature of L1Md promoters, and it makes studying the transcription activity and regulation of L1Md elements a challenging task.,To generate inheritable insertions, retrotransposons must propagate in the genome during germ cell development or early embryogenesis. This also means the host must prevent retrotransposon proliferation at the same time to effectively protect genome integrity at specific loci and preserve overall genome size. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark that is employed to regulate retrotransposon expression in vertebrates and plants [15–17]. While DNA methylation is being constantly maintained in most cell types, it is erased and re-established during the epigenetic reprogramming of germ cell development in almost the entire genome [18]. This process potentially leaves a window for retrotransposon transcription. It has been shown that by default most of the genome is quickly re-methylated during reprogramming, except for regions that are occupied by active chromatin marks [19], likely indicating occupancy by some DNA-binding protein directly interfering with the addition of methyl groups. Nevertheless, this does not guarantee repression of already actively expressed retrotransposons. It is known that proteins of the Piwi family are responsible for regulating retrotransposon expression levels through a conserved Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which specifically targets retrotransposon transcripts in germ cells [20, 21]. The piRNA pathway is also found to guide de novo DNA methylation to silence retrotransposon promoters [22, 23]. Since this mechanism is highly sequence-sensitive, a detailed classification of retrotransposons, especially their promoters, can provide insight into the regulation of retrotransposon transcription.,The monomer structure increases the difficulty of both the classification and functional annotation for L1Md elements. It remains elusive how L1Md elements adopted the tandemly repeating monomers as their promoters during evolution. Since it was shown that multiple monomers in one promoter have linearly additive effect for transcription activity [24, 25], it is possible that the promoter expansion mechanism has also elevated the transcription activity of L1Md elements. However, a genome-wide annotation of L1Md promoter activity is still lacking.,Due to the retrotransposition mechanism, most L1Md elements are 5’-truncated [11], resulting in retro-elements incapable of initiating transcription. Thus, although the total number of L1 elements in the mouse genome is in the order of hundreds of thousands, the number of promoter-containing full-length L1 elements is estimated to be less than 20 thousand [26, 27]. The state-of-art classification of mouse L1 elements includes 29 families [26]. In most cases, L1Md families are named after their promoter types, which are determined by the type of monomers contained in one promoter. Currently there are three known monomer types: A, Gf and Tf [12, 28, 29]. The latter two originated from one common ancestor type, the F type [13], and there is no significant sequence similarity between the A type and other monomer types. These three monomer types are active in terms of transcription, and therefore L1Md families which contain these monomers are likely to be capable of retrotransposition. In addition to the monomer type classification, it has been shown that the A type can be further divided to six subtypes based on sequence difference at a finer scale [30]. However, this subtype definition is based on a limited number of sequences, and it is unclear whether any unknown A subtypes exist in the mouse genome. To the best of our knowledge, no subtype identification of the Gf and Tf types has been reported.,Annotation of L1 elements in practice usually emphasizes the termini of consensus sequences. For example, in the most commonly used database of retrotransposon consensus sequences, RepBase [31], sequences related to L1 are stored as the 5’-end, including 5’ UTR and ORF1, and the 3’-end, including ORF2 and 3’ UTR. The names of these consensus sequences are used by the annotation software RepeatMasker [32] for family classification of retrotransposons. Given the fact that recombination between retrotransposons frequently occurs during evolution [26, 33], it is possible that the ORF1 and promoter of a single L1 element can actually belong to different families, and thus the resulting classification can be ambiguous and misleading when using the annotation information for a retrotransposon as the basis for its biological inference. For example, an L1 element may have switched its promoter from F type to A type due to some rearrangement event. This could alter transcriptional behavior, but such a retrotransposon would remain classified as an L1MdF element based on downstream sequences. In a comprehensive analysis of transcriptionally active retro-elements, such retrotransposons would be excluded because of their classification.,Here we present a de novo monomer detection pipeline to precisely locate tandemly repeated sequence in the 5’ UTR of L1 elements. This pipeline uses profile-HMM to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of monomer detection. After detection, monomers are comprehensively considered for identification of subtypes. We show that the current subtype classification of Type A monomers can be greatly expanded, and the subtypes of Gf and Tf type monomers are also discovered. Our stochastic model based definition of subtypes can be used to represent the diverse with-in group variance of monomers, which reflects their evolutionary ages. Based on this framework, we annotate the activity of L1Md promoters during germ cell development using epigenetic data. These results suggests that the regulation of piRNA-guided de novo DNA methylation on functional L1Md promoters is through pairings of specific monomer subtypes and individual activities that comprise the piRNA pathway."

                        Tc1/mariner transposonsLuciferase assay, transcriptional regulation, transposition, DMelanogaster, SCerevisiae, HSapiens, EColi","We have recently described a peculiar feature of the promoters in two Drosophila Tc1-like elements, Bari1 and Bari3. The AT-richness and the presence of weak core-promoter motifs make these promoters, that we have defined “blurry”, able to activate transcription of a reporter gene in cellular systems as diverse as fly, human, yeast and bacteria. In order to clarify whether the blurry promoter is a specific feature of the Bari transposon family, we have extended this study to promoters isolated from three additional DNA transposon and from two additional LTR retrotransposons.,Here we show that the blurry promoter is also a feature of two vertebrate transposable elements, Sleeping Beauty and Hsmar1, belonging to the Tc1/mariner superfamily. In contrast, this feature is not shared by the promoter of the hobo transposon, which belongs to the hAT superfamily, nor by LTR retrotransposon-derived promoters, which, in general, do not activate transcription when introduced into non-related genomes.,Our results suggest that the blurry promoter could be a shared feature of the members of the Tc1/mariner superfamily with possible evolutionary and biotechnological implications.,Transposable elements (TEs) are widespread genetic elements that have played a fundamental role in genome evolution [1], contributing to generating diversity, both at small and large scale [2], and to evolving new functions through molecular domestication [3] or exaptation [4]. Their ubiquitous presence in the genomes of extant species suggests an ancient history dating back to early living organisms, as well as an extraordinary ability to overcome the canonical genetic barriers between species, the latter being an intrinsic feature of the horizontal gene transfer process (HGT).,TEs, like other genes, are usually transmitted from parents to offspring, and propagate in the population. In parallel to one or several bursts of genomic expansion TEs are subjected to mutational load, denoting their a neutral mode of evolution. The overall absence of selection acting on TEs establishes a kind of “genomic homeostasis”, i.e. a balance in terms of numbers of functional and non-autonomous TE copies. When mutant copies overcome functional ones, the TE is destined to extinction in the genome in which it resides, an effect that could be also translated at the species level [5, 6]. Horizontal Transposon Transfer (HTT) is an important mechanism that mobile genetic elements undertake to escape extinction.,Tc1 and mariner are two related DNA transposon families, part of the Tc1/mariner/pogo/IS630 (typically referred to as Tc1/mariner in short) superfamily. They were first identified in nematode [7] and insect [8] genomes respectively, and are both characterized by an open reading frame encoding a transposase flanked by two terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and TA dinucleotides representing duplicated target sites [9]. Previous studies have identified Tc1-like elements in a variety of animals and fungi [10], as well as in the parasitic amoebozoa Entamoeba invadens [11] and in plants [12]. The ubiquitous presence of Tc1/mariner-like elements in the genomes of virtually all extant eukaryotic species and the phylogenetic inconsistencies found in many cases studied [13, 14] support the hypotheses that they are ancient components of the eukaryotic genomes and could have also spread by means of HTT [15].,The establishment of a TE in a new genome after a HTT event depends on the expression of the TE-encoded genes required for element mobilization and propagation. Considering that expression of such genes relies to a large extent on the activity of their own promoters, it can be predicted that the greater the evolutionary distance between the donor and recipient species involved in the HTT event, the lesser the chance that the promoter could be recognized by transcription factors of the new host. Translated in terms of transposition efficiency, insufficient expression of transposition-related proteins would mean that the TE will be “dead on arrival” in the new host unless other surviving strategies are adopted.,We have recently reported that the promoter elements isolated from two related Drosophila Tc1-like transposons, Bari1 and Bari3, are functional in evolutionarily distant genomic backgrounds [16]. These transposons carry an AT-rich “blurry promoter” with divergent or no sharply predictable core-promoter motifs, which is able to drive transcription when transplanted into an unrelated genetic and genomic context. On the basis of our previously reported results, we hypothesized that this feature could be important for the success of HTT events of such genetic elements. The TF/TFBS (Transcription Factor/Transcription Factor Binding Site) recognition is indeed the result of complex co-evolution processes [17] that does not allow promoters to work properly in divergent genetic backgrounds. Our previous results [16], based on the comparison of the promoters of the Bari1 and Bari3 transposons with that of an LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) retrotransposon (the copia element), suggested that the blurry promoter is a peculiarity of the Tc1 family.,Here, in order to further investigate the existence of the blurry promoter in Tc1-like elements from other organisms and to assess whether mariner-like elements also have similar feature, we extended our study to the promoters of two additional members of the Tc1/mariner superfamily [Sleeping Beauty (SB) from fish and Hsmar1 from human] and two additional LTR retrotransposons (Tirant and ZAM) from D. melanogaster. Furthermore, we included in this study the promoter of hobo, a member of the hAT superfamily (named after the hobo, Activator and Tam3 founding elements [18]). The hAT superfamily represents an ideal outgroup to assess whether Class II elements, not related to the Tc1/mariner superfamily and able to undertake HTT [19,20,21,22], have blurry promoters that allow them to survive once transferred into distant genomes.,Our results suggest that the blurry promoter is a feature shared by the elements of the Tc1/mariner superfamily tested in this study, while the promoters of hobo, Tirant and Zam are usually functional within a limited range of genomic environments strictly related to the species of origin."

Consequently, MULEs are important genetic tools and represent a key study system for research into host-transposon interactions. Yet, while several studies have focused on the impacts of MULEs on crop and fungus genomes, their evolution remains poorly explored.,We perform comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses to address currently available MULE diversity and reconstruct evolution for the group. For this, we mine MULEs from online databases, and combine search results with available transposase sequences retrieved from previously published studies. Our analyses uncover two entirely new MULE clades that contain elements almost entirely restricted to arthropod hosts, considerably expanding the set of MULEs known from this group, suggesting that many additional MULEs may await discovery from further arthropod genomes. In several cases, close relationships occur between MULEs recovered from distantly related host organisms, suggesting that horizontal transfer events may have played an important role in the evolution of the group. However, it is apparent that MULEs from plants remain separate from MULEs identified from other host groups. MULE structure varies considerably across phylogeny, and TIR length is shown to vary greatly both within and between MULE groups. Our phylogeny suggests that MULE diversity is clustered in well-supported groups, typically according to host taxonomy. With reference to this, we make suggestions on how MULE diversity can be partitioned to provide a robust taxonomic framework.,Our study represents a considerable advance in the understanding of MULE diversity, host range and evolution, and provides a taxonomic framework for the classification of further MULE elements that await discovery. Our findings also raise a number of questions relating to MULE biology, suggesting that this group will provide a rich avenue for future study.,Mutator transposable elements (TEs) are among the most mutagenic transposons known, due to their very high rates of transposition and their bias for inserting near or close to genes [1, 2]. The original Robertson’s Mutator element (MuDR, ‘Mutator Don Robertson’) was described in maize, where Mutator lines can display mutation frequencies ~ 50 times the background rate of spontaneous mutation [3, 4]. Given these qualities, the Mutator system has a long history of usage in the field of genetic engineering in both forward and reverse genetic screening, and has played an important role in shaping our understanding of host-transposon co-evolutionary interactions [2].,Members of the Mutator DNA transposon superfamily are termed ‘MULEs’ (Mutator-like elements) [5]. The structure of MULEs resembles classic “cut-and-paste” DNA TEs, with Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) at each end enclosing a transposase domain containing a catalytic DDE motif, and often an additional zinc finger DNA-binding motif. However, MULE TIRs are typically considerably longer than those present in other DNA TE superfamilies, commonly being hundreds of base pairs in length. Meanwhile, some families of MULE appear to lack TIRs completely (non-TIR MULEs) [6]. A further characteristic of MULEs is the length of their target site duplications (TSDs), which are short direct repeats created following transposition, that occur immediately outside of the TIRs and are 8-11 bp in MULE elements [5].,An interesting feature of several MULEs is their acquisition of one or more additional open reading frames (ORFs). The first complete MULE element described in maize contained two ORFs: mudrA, encoding the transposase, and mudrB, encoding a protein of unknown function that is apparently required for integration into the maize genome [7, 8]. Other classes of MULE may also contain additional ORFs, such as the mutB ORF with a DNA binding role in the yeast Mutyl element that occurs in the same orientation as the transposase ORF [9], or the vanB and vanC ORFs in the arabidopsis Hiun element, which are divergent proteins with unknown and anti-silencing functions, respectively [10]. It is often assumed that additional ORFs originate from the host genome, as has been demonstrated in rice and several other plant genomes [6, 11]. In plant genomes there are large numbers of non-autonomous Mutator elements known collectively as ‘Pack-MULEs’, that have lost their transposase genes and instead carry fragments of host genes [12]. Additionally, there is evidence that several MULEs have undergone molecular domestication and become exapted by host genomes. For example, MULE-derived genes act as transcription factors that modulate the light response in Arabidopsis [13, 14], while the MULE-derived MUSTANG genes, which are present in all flowering plants, are involved in diverse processes including flowering, growth and reproduction, and may have played an important role in early angiosperm evolution [15].,MULEs are best known from plant genomes, and especially maize [7], but they also occur in a wide range of eukaryotic genomes [2]. For example, over the last 15 years, studies have described MULEs from diverse hosts, including several ascomycete species [16], the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica [9], the Oomycete genus Phytophthora [17], amoeba from the genus Entamoeba [18], the excavate Trichomonas vaginalis [19], diatoms [20], the mosquito Aedes aegypti [21], and the trematode Schistosoma [22]. However, MULEs were detected in the animal kingdom only recently [23, 24], and in general very little remains known about MULEs from metazoan genomes [21, 22].,In common with other DNA transposons, MULEs contain a DDE catalytic domain with structural features in common with other Class II TEs and the integrase domain of Class I LTR-retrotransposons [25]. The DDE domain is typically more highly conserved than other regions, and DDE sequences are often employed in phylogenetic analyses [26]. Analyses across DNA TE diversity utilising the DDE domain have indicated that MULEs share the closest relationship to P and hAT elements [26, 27]. Several phylogenetic analyses have also attempted to reconstruct evolution within the MULE superfamily [16, 18, 22, 24]. However, the most recent consideration of MULE evolution was in 2011, where the transposase amino acid sequences of just 39 MULE elements from 26 host genomes resulted in the division of the included sequences into 6 families (MuDR, TvCaMULE, Curupira, EMULE, Hop/Jittery, and Phantom) [22]. Given the recent accumulation of genome sequencing data, we revisit the question of MULE evolution. We perform bioinformatic analyses to mine new members of the MULE superfamily, and phylogenetic analyses to update and further investigate the evolutionary history of this important group of DNA TEs."

A genome-wide analysis of the D. melanogaster genome found that differences in TE density across 50 kb genomic regions was due both to transposition and duplication. At smaller genomic scales, promoter regions of hsp genes and the promoter region of CG18446 have been shown to accumulate TE insertions. In this work, we have further analyzed the promoter region of CG18446. We screened 218 strains collected in 15 natural populations, and we found that the CG18446 promoter region contains 20 independent roo insertions. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we suggest that the presence of multiple roo insertions in this region is likely to be the result of several bursts of transposition. Moreover, we found that the roo insertional cluster in the CG18446 promoter region is unique: no other promoter region in the genome contains a similar number of roo insertions. We found that, similar to hsp gene promoters, chromatin accessibility could be one of the factors explaining the recurrent insertions of roo elements in CG18446 promoter region.,Recurrent insertion of transposable elements in specific genomic regions has been described in the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome. The analysis of 50 kb genomic windows identified 23 regions with a high density of TE insertions, most of them located in pericentromeric regions or on chromosome 4 [1]. Transposition and duplication were identified as the two mechanisms generating these high-density TE regions. In recent years, computational pipelines have been developed to analyze the TE content in multiple strains [2,3,4]. Thus, besides TEs annotated in the reference genome, non-reference TE insertions can now also be analyzed. Based on these population analyses, some genes have also been reported to accumulate many TE insertions, such as the 106.5 kb klarsicht, and the 24 kb derailed-2 that were analyzed in 146 strains of the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource [5, 6]. At a much finer scale, several insertions in the proximal promoter regions of hsp genes have been reported [7, 8]. While the vast majority of these insertions were P-elements, insertions from the Gypsy and the Jockey family were also identified. P-elements have a preference to insert in 5′ gene flanking regions [9]. The accumulation of TEs in the promoter of hsp genes was explained by the chromatin conformation of this particular region, and by selection favoring the retention of TEs because of their effect on gene expression [8]. More recently, nine roo insertions were also described in the promoter region of another stress response gene, CG18446 that encodes a nucleic acid binding protein [10]. CG18446 is a cold resistance candidate gene [11] and an ethanol-regulated gene [12] highly expressed in ovaries and in 6–10 h-old embryos [13]. Only one of the nine identified insertions was found to consistently affect the expression of CG18446, and it was associated with increased viability in nonstress and cold-stress conditions [10]. However, only 39 strains from two natural populations were screened, and thus it is still an open question whether more roo insertions are present in the CG18446 promoter region. Indeed, roo are the most abundant elements in the D. melanogaster genome [14, 15]. Thus, it is possible that besides the cluster identified by Merenciano et al. (2016) [10] other similar clusters of roo insertions in gene promoter regions are present in the genome. Interestingly, while the majority of strains analyzed so far contain a roo insertion (26 out of 39), none of them contains more than one insertion [10].,In this work, we looked for TE insertions in the CG18446 promoter region in 218 strains from 15 natural populations in Europe, North America, and Africa. In addition, based on the analysis of the reference genome, and on the analysis of 177 DGRP strains, we identified 53 promoter regions that could potentially contain multiple roo insertions. Finally, we performed fecundity and viability experiments to investigate why we did not find any fly containing two roo insertions in the CG18446 promoter region."

Currently ~ 3000 adult and ~ 30 pluripotent stem cell-based, interventional clinical trials are ongoing worldwide, and numbers are increasing continuously. Although stem cells are promising cell sources to treat a wide range of human diseases, there are also concerns regarding potential risks associated with their clinical use, including genomic instability and tumorigenesis concerns. Thus, a deeper understanding of the factors and molecular mechanisms contributing to stem cell genome stability are a prerequisite to harnessing their therapeutic potential for degenerative diseases. Chemical and physical factors are known to influence the stability of stem cell genomes, together with random mutations and Copy Number Variants (CNVs) that accumulated in cultured human stem cells. Here we review the activity of endogenous transposable elements (TEs) in human multipotent and pluripotent stem cells, and the consequences of their mobility for genomic integrity and host gene expression. We describe transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms antagonizing the spread of TEs in the human genome, and highlight those that are more prevalent in multipotent and pluripotent stem cells. Notably, TEs do not only represent a source of mutations/CNVs in genomes, but are also often harnessed as tools to engineer the stem cell genome; thus, we also describe and discuss the most widely applied transposon-based tools and highlight the most relevant areas of their biomedical applications in stem cells. Taken together, this review will contribute to the assessment of the risk that endogenous TE activity and the application of genetically engineered TEs constitute for the biosafety of stem cells to be used for substitutive and regenerative cell therapies.,Regenerative medicine is a recent and emerging branch of medical science, addressing functional restoration of specific tissues and/or organs of patients suffering from severe injuries or chronic diseases in a condition where the organism’s own regenerative responses do not suffice [1]. Stem cells are defined by their ability to regenerate multiple differentiated cell types, while retaining the capacity to self-replicate and self-renew. Those found in vivo have different origins and can be divided into three broad categories accordingly: embryonic (ESCs), foetal (FSCs) and adult stem cells (ASCs). Among the latter are hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which represent the most used stem cell types in current clinical trials.,ESCs are derived from the inner cell mass of human blastocysts, have the potential for self-renewal, and are considered pluripotent: they maintain the ability to differentiate into cells and tissues from the three main germ layers [2] and generate all the tissues found in an organism. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) emerged as a primary cell source for regenerative medicine in recent years, to repair tissue and organ anomalies that resulted from congenital defects, disease, age and environment-associated effects. Similar characteristics are associated with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), although these are generated in vitro by ectopic expression of endogenous pluripotency factors which epigenetically transform terminally differentiated cells into ESC-like cells [3, 4].,FSCs, the second category of stem cells, are located in foetal tissues and embryonic annexes and are multipotent: they can differentiate into cell types from some, but not all of the three main germ layers [5]. FSCs have been subdivided into hematopoietic (blood, liver, bone marrow), mesenchymal (blood, liver, bone marrow, lung, kidney and pancreas), endothelial (bone marrow, placenta), epithelial (liver, pancreas) and neuronal stem cells (neurons, glia and oligodendrocytes [6].,The third category, termed ASCs or progenitor cells, comprises multipotent tissue-resident stem cells found in fully developed tissues. They reside in niches that create a special microenvironment for their replication and self-renewal. Domiciled in most tissues of the human body, discrete populations of ASCs generate cells to replace those that are lost through normal repair, disease, or injury. ASCs are found throughout the lifetime of the organism and were identified in tissues such as the umbilical cord, placenta, bone marrow, muscle, brain, fat tissue, skin, gut, etc. ASCs are thought to act to repair and regenerate tissues in which they reside, helping to maintain tissue homeostasis.,Adult stem cells such as HSCs, MSCs, and neural stem cells (NSCs) are the most frequently used cell types in interventional clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov) (Fig. 1a). HSCs are essential for the generation and homeostasis of the blood system, and give rise to all blood cell types, including lymphocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and platelets [7]. Indeed, HSC transplantation is the accepted therapy of choice for a variety of malignant and non-malignant blood-related diseases in children and adults. Initially developed as rescue therapy for a patient with cancer after high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, as well as the correction of severe deficiencies in the hematopoietic system, it has evolved into an adoptive immune therapy for malignancies and autoimmune disorders [8]. Human MSCs are multipotent stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into the mesodermal lineage such as osteocytes, adipocytes and chondrocytes, as well as some ectodermal (neurocytes) and endodermal lineages (hepatocytes) [9]. MSCs have been isolated from various tissues including bone marrow, adipose tissue, amniotic fluid, endometrium, dental tissues, umbilical cord and Wharton’s jelly [9]. MSCs have immunomodulatory features and secrete cytokines and immune receptors which regulate the microenvironment in the host tissue [10]. Multilineage potential, immunomodulation and secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules makes MSCs an effective tool in the treatment of chronic diseases. Consequently, there are several clinical trials harnessing their innate characteristics or other in vitro observations in a series of diseases (for a review see [11]). NSCs are a group of ectodermal progenitor cells which can differentiate into neural subtypes, such as neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Neural stem cell derivatives are used in a number of clinical trial applications including treatments of ALS and Parkinson’s Disease [12,13,14] and currently ongoing interventional clinical trials (Fig. 1a).,Human stem cell-based clinical studies conducted worldwide (Status: October 2018; www.clinicaltrials.gov). a Interventional clinical trials (Phase I or phase I/II) applying adult stem cell types (mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs; hematopoietic stem cells, HSCs; neuronal stem cells, NSCs) or their differentiated derivatives, or embryonic stem cell (ESC)-or induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived differentiated cells. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of individual trials based on the respective stem cell type. b Interventional clinical trials and observational studies that are currently ongoing or in preparation use therapeutic derivatives of ESCs (blue lettering) or iPSCs (green lettering) to treat ophthalmic, urological, blood, cardiac and genital diseases, neurological disorders and cancers/neoplasms. Numbers in brackets represent the number of clinical trials and/or observational studies initiated to treat the respective disease or disorder,In contrast to MSCs and other types of tissue-specific stem cells, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are derived either from human pre-implantation embryos, giving rise to hESCs [2, 15], or from somatic cells that are reprogrammed to a primitive pluripotent state (hiPSCs). PSCs are immortal and highly expandable in culture in vitro, and can be differentiated to almost any cell type of the body. Their potential for regenerative medicine is therefore unique and extraordinary. Indeed, cellular products derived from hESCs are now in clinical trials for cardiac and ophthalmic diseases and neurological disorders, with some other applications registered for clinical trial approval (Fig. 1b) [12,13,14]. Initially, hiPSCs have been used in one experimental procedure in an autologous approach on an individual in Japan with macular degeneration [16, 17]. In March 2017, the first study was initiated involving 5 AMD (Age-related macular degeneration) patients who received retina cells derived from banked hiPSCs in an allogeneic approach [18]. To date, 11 interventional clinical trials and 25 observational studies are based on the application of iPSCs (Fig. 1). However, and despite these trials in the frontier of knowledge, relatively little is known about undesired long-term effects of such approaches.,The promise for human disease treatment using differentiated cells derived from multipotent ASCs and pluripotent stem cells, such as hESCs and hiPSCs, also carries the threat of genomic instability of the cells to be administered. Firstly, cultivation of multipotent and pluripotent stem cells exposes the cells to selection pressures that often result in the acquisition and manifestation of genomic alterations, varying in size from point mutations, through copy number changes in small genomic elements (e.g. amplification of repetitive sequences and retroelement mobility), to large chromosomal aberrations, trisomies and monosomies [19,20,21]. Previous reviews reported several factors that contribute to differences in genomic and epigenomic stabilities of stem cells, including derivation source (embryonic vs. somatic cells), derivation methods (direct isolation vs. reprogramming), and culture conditions [22]. Much attention has been drawn in recent years to the genomic aberrations acquired by hESCs and hiPSCs, ranging from point mutations to whole-chromosome trisomies [23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. Similarly, human ASCs that are expanded in culture were also shown to be prone to acquire chromosomal aberrations [24]. Secondly, the treatment of many human diseases often involve genetic manipulation of stem cells prior to transplantation, which may further jeopardize their genomic stability. Overall, genomic aberrations can affect identity, differentiation capability and tumorigenicity of stem cells, and should thus be routinely evaluated for their proper use in basic research and in clinical trials. In the promising era of stem cell research and therapy, ensuring genomic stability of stem cells and their derivatives remains one of the highest priorities prior to clinical translation.,In this review, we focus on one specific source of genomic instability in human therapeutically relevant stem cells that has been mostly ignored by the stem cell community to date, namely the activity of endogenous non-Long Terminal Repeat (non-LTR)-retrotransposons, and the consequences for genomic integrity and host gene expression. Non-LTR retrotransposons constitute our center of attention because in contrast to most TEs in our genome, a small fraction of this group of TEs is currently active and mobilized in the human population [31, 32]. We provide an overview of the impact of endogenous TEs in pluripotent and adult stem cells, discuss new roles of TEs in regulating pluripotency, and describe host defense systems counteracting TE activity in stem cells. Furthermore, we address the application of DNA-transposons to genetically engineer human stem cells for medical applications. In order to fulfill the standards for safe clinical applications and evaluate the risk for biosafety inflicted on therapeutically relevant cells by TE activity, we propose that the extent of the activity of potentially mutagenic TEs in pluripotent stem cells needs to be elucidated, and perhaps used as an additional quality control check point in the future."

Our recent studies in pancreatic and ovarian cancer demonstrate the ability of TIPseq to identify invariant (fixed), polymorphic (inherited variants), as well as somatically-acquired L1 insertions that distinguish cancer genomes from a patient’s constitutional make-up.,TIPseq provides an approach for amplifying evolutionarily young, active transposable element insertion sites from genomic DNA. Our rationale and variations on this protocol may be useful to those mapping L1 and other mobile elements in complex genomes.,Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) is one of the most abundant mobile DNAs in humans. With roughly 500,000 copies, LINE-1 sequences comprise about 17% of our DNA [1]. Although most of these exist in an invariant (fixed) state and are no longer active, about 500 insertions of the Homo sapiens specific L1 sequences (L1Hs) are more variable and derive from a few ‘hot’ L1Hs that remain transcriptionally and transpositionally active [2,3,4,5,6,7]. The activity of LINE-1 results in transposable element insertions that are a significant source of structural variation in our genomes [8,9,10,11]. They are responsible for new germline L1 insertion events as well as the retrotransposition of other mobile DNA sequences including Alu Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) [12,13,14,15] and SVA (SINE/VNTR/Alu) retrotransposons [16]. Additionally, LINE-1 can propagate in somatic tissues, and somatically-acquired insertions are frequently found in human cancers [17,18,19,20,21,22,23].,Characterizations of transposable element sequences remain incomplete in part because their highly repetitive nature poses technical challenges. Using these high copy number repeats as probes or primer sequences can create signals or products in hybridization-based assays and PCR amplifications that do not correspond to discrete genomic loci. Moreover, both the absence of many common insertion variants from the reference genome assembly as well as the presence of hundreds of thousands of similar sequences together complicate sequencing read mappability. Detecting insertions that occur as low frequency alleles in a mixed sample presents an additional challenge, such as occurs with somatically-acquired insertions. Nevertheless, several recent studies describe strategies for mapping these elements and highlight LINE-1 continued activity in humans today. These methods include hybridization-based enrichment [24,25,26,27,28,29]; selective PCR amplification [6, 17, 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39]; and tailored analyses of whole genome sequencing reads [10, 11, 18, 19, 40, 41].,Here we present a detailed protocol to amplify and sequence human LINE-1 retrotransposon insertion loci developed in the Burns and Boeke laboratories, Transposon Insertion Profiling by sequencing (TIPseq) [22, 23, 42,43,44]. This method uses ligation-mediated, vectorette PCR [45] to selectively amplify regions of genomic DNA directly 3′ of L1Hs elements. This is followed by library preparation and Illumina deep sequencing (see Fig. 1a). TIPseq locates fixed, polymorphic, and somatic L1Hs insertions with base pair precision and determines orientation of the insertion (i.e., if it is on the plus (+) or minus (−) strand with respect to the reference genome). It detects, though does not distinguish between, both full length and 5′ truncated insertions as short as 150 bp. TIPseq is highly accurate in identifying somatic L1 insertions in tumor versus matched normal tissues, and allows sequencing coverage to be efficiently targeted to LINE-1 insertion sites so it is an economical way to process samples for this purpose. We have used TIPseq to demonstrate LINE-1 retrotransposition in pancreatic [22] and ovarian [23] cancers, and to show that somatically-acquired insertions are not common in glioblastomas [44]. Together with the machine learning-based computational pipeline developed in the Fenyӧ Lab for processing TIPseq data, TIPseqHunter [23], this protocol allows researchers to map LINE-1 insertion sites in human genomic DNA samples and compare insertion sites across samples.,Steps in the TIPseq protocol. a Steps in TIPseq are shown from top to bottom in a vertical flow chart. These include (i.) vectorette adapter annealing, (ii.) genomic DNA (gDNA) digestion, (iii.) vectorette adapter ligation, (iv.) vectorette touchdown PCR, (v.) PCR amplicon shearing, (vi.) sequencing library preparation, (vii.) Illumina sequencing, and, (viii.) data analysis. The first seven of these steps are shown adjacent to schematic representations in part b., to the right. b Vectorette adapter annealing is shown first. Mismatched sequences within the hybridized vectorette oligonucleotides are illustrated in red and blue, and create a duplex structure with imperfect base pairing. The sticky end overhang on one strand of the vectorette (here, a 5′ overhang on the bottom strand) is drawn in gray. This overhang in the annealed vectorette complements sticky ends left by genomic DNA digest, and the digest and vectorette ligations are shown in the subsequent two steps. The black box within the gDNA fragment illustrate a LINE-1 element of interest (i.e., a species-specific L1Hs). Most gDNA fragments will not have a transposable element of interest, and thus cannot be amplified efficiently by the vectorette PCR. In vectorette PCR, the L1Hs primer begins first strand synthesis (1) and extends this strand through the ligated vectorette sequence. The reverse primer complements this first-strand copy of the vectorette (2) and the two primers participate in exponential amplification (3) of these fragments in subsequent cycles. c Amplicons are sheared, and conventional Illumina sequencing library preparation steps complete the protocol. Paired-end sequencing reads are required to perform data analysis with TIPseqHunter. d A diagram of read pile-ups demonstrate how there is deep coverage of the 3′ end of L1Hs elements. For elements on the plus (+) strand with respect to the reference genome, the amplified sequences are downstream of the insertion site (i.e., covering genomic coordinates ascending from the transposon insertion). For minus (−) stranded insertions, sequences are recovered in the opposite direction"

              ","Pseudomonas syringae is a γ-proteobacterium causing economically relevant diseases in practically all cultivated plants. Most isolates of this pathogen contain native plasmids collectively carrying many pathogenicity and virulence genes. However, P. syringae is generally an opportunistic pathogen primarily inhabiting environmental reservoirs, which could exert a low selective pressure for virulence plasmids. Additionally, these plasmids usually contain a large proportion of repeated sequences, which could compromise plasmid integrity. Therefore, the identification of plasmid stability determinants and mechanisms to preserve virulence genes is essential to understand the evolution of this pathogen and its adaptability to agroecosystems.,The three virulence plasmids of P. syringae pv. savastanoi NCPPB 3335 contain from one to seven functional stability determinants, including three highly active toxin-antitoxin systems (TA) in both pPsv48A and pPsv48C. The TA systems reduced loss frequency of pPsv48A by two orders of magnitude, whereas one of the two replicons of pPsv48C likely confers stable inheritance by itself. Notably, inactivation of the TA systems from pPsv48C exposed the plasmid to high-frequency deletions promoted by mobile genetic elements. Thus, recombination between two copies of MITEPsy2 caused the deletion of an 8.3 kb fragment, with a frequency of 3.8 ± 0.3 × 10− 3. Likewise, one-ended transposition of IS801 generated plasmids containing deletions of variable size, with a frequency of 5.5 ± 2.1 × 10− 4, of which 80% had lost virulence gene idi. These deletion derivatives were stably maintained in the population by replication mediated by repJ, which is adjacent to IS801. IS801 also promoted deletions in plasmid pPsv48A, either by recombination or one-ended transposition. In all cases, functional TA systems contributed significantly to reduce the occurrence of plasmid deletions in vivo.,Virulence plasmids from P. syringae harbour a diverse array of stability determinants with a variable contribution to plasmid persistence. Importantly, we showed that multiple plasmid-borne TA systems have a prominent role in preserving plasmid integrity and ensuring the maintenance of virulence genes in free-living conditions. This strategy is likely widespread amongst native plasmids of P. syringae and other bacteria.,Plasmids are dispensable extrachromosomal elements widely distributed in bacteria, facilitating their survival and the colonization of eukaryotic hosts [1,2,3,4]. The plasticity and transmissibility of plasmids contribute to a rapid dissemination of resistance and virulence genes, thus promoting the emergence of uncontrollable bacterial diseases, both in clinical and agricultural settings [5,6,7,8]. However, plasmids are usually large and exist in several copies per cell, potentially imposing a significant metabolic burden to the cell, which might facilitate the emergence of plasmid-free derivatives in the absence of selection for plasmid-borne characters [7, 9]. This metabolic cost can be lowered by diverse plasmid-host adaptations, such as deletions, mutations in the plasmid replication machinery, or chromosomal mutations [7, 9]. Additionally, plasmids can increase their stability by conjugal transfer and/or by carrying a battery of specifically dedicated genetic determinants, classified into three main categories [9,10,11]. Partition determinants, in the first category, direct the active segregation of plasmid molecules during cell division. All low-copy plasmids appear to contain a partition system, which usually consists of an operon of two genes plus a specific DNA sequence for recognition. Multimer resolution systems comprise the second category and include recombinases that resolve plasmid cointegrates and maximize the number of plasmid copies available at cell division. The third category, postsegregational killing systems, include toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems and, less prominently, restriction modification loci; these systems ensure plasmid maintenance by inhibiting cell growth.,The Pseudomonas syringae complex is considered the most important bacterial plant pathogen in the world [12]. Most strains contain plasmids with an array of adaptive genes that increase aggressiveness, expand their host range, and confer resistance to antibacterials or to UV light [1, 6, 13,14,15]. Most of these plasmids belong to the so-called pPT23A-family plasmids (PFP) group, characterized by sharing the highly conserved RepA-PFP replicon. These replicons are highly plastic and adaptable, and strains often contain two or more stably co-existing PFP plasmids [6, 16,17,18]. Insertion sequences, transposons and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) can account for at least a third of a PFP plasmid, actively participating in the acquisition and exchange of adaptive characters [17,18,19,20,21]. Insertion sequence IS801 (1.5 kb), and its isoforms, is particularly significant because of its relatively high transposition frequency, its common association with virulence genes and its ability to undergo one-ended transposition, whereby the element can mobilize adjacent DNA [19, 21, 22]. Additionally, plasmids of P. syringae have a mosaic structure and often share extensive regions of similarity, suggesting their evolution through the acquisition and loss of large DNA regions in a multistep process [14,15,16,17, 20, 23]. Despite this, plasmid profiles of individual strains appear to be characteristic and stable, although certain plasmids can be lost with high frequency under certain culture conditions [1, 24,25,26,27]. Agricultural settings exert a strong selection pressure on P. syringae populations, generally towards highly virulent clones adapted to single hosts, which can be accomplished both by gain and loss of certain virulence genes [23, 28]. However, P. syringae is an opportunistic pathogen whose life cycle primarily occurs in a variety of outside-host environments, including living on the surface of plants without causing disease [29]. It is not clear what mechanisms are driving the maintenance of virulence genes in free-living populations, where selection pressure for pathogenicity should be predictably low. Although diverse potential stability determinants were identified among PFP plasmids [15,16,17,18, 30,31,32], it is not yet clear whether or not they are functional and what their role in the bacterial life cycle is.,P. syringae pv. savastanoi NCPPB 3335 causes tumours in olive (Olea europaea) and is a prominent model for the study of the molecular basis of pathogenicity on woody hosts [33, 34]. This strain contains three PFP virulence plasmids pPsv48A (80 kb), pPsv48B (45 kb) and pPsv48C (42 kb) [18]. Plasmid pPsv48A carries the virulence gene ptz, involved in the biosynthesis of cytokinins, and the Type III effector gene hopAF1; pPsv48B carries the Type III effector gene hopAO1 and, in turn, plasmid pPsv48C carries the virulence gene idi, potentially involved in cytokinin biosynthesis. Both pPsv48A and pPsv48C are essential for the production of tumours in olive plants [18, 35], whereas pPsv48B contributes to fitness and virulence in planta [36]. Although pPsv48A and pPsv48B can be cured, pPsv48C is remarkably stable and could not be evicted from strain NCPPB 3335 [18], perhaps because it carries two different replicons [37]. We were interested in the identification and characterization of the stability determinants of the plasmid complement of strain NCPPB 3335, to gain insights into the mechanisms allowing the long-term maintenance of PFP plasmids and the dynamics of virulence genes.,Here, we determined that the three virulence plasmids from P. syringae pv. savastanoi NCPPB 3335 carry from one to seven functional stability determinants of different types, including three highly active TA systems in both pPsv48A and pPsv48C, although the two replicons in pPsv48C are likely sufficient for full stability. We serendipitously discovered that the mobile genetic elements IS801 and MITEPsy2 promote plasmid deletions and reorganizations with very high frequency. These derivatives are, however, efficiently excluded from the bacterial populations thanks to multiple plasmidic TA systems, which simultaneously favour the maintenance of virulence genes ptz and idi when outside the plant."

                        ",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-019-0150-y,RepetDBTransposable elementDatabase,"Thanks to their ability to move around and replicate within genomes, transposable elements (TEs) are perhaps the most important contributors to genome plasticity and evolution. Their detection and annotation are considered essential in any genome sequencing project. The number of fully sequenced genomes is rapidly increasing with improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies. A fully automated de novo annotation process for TEs is therefore required to cope with the deluge of sequence data.,However, all automated procedures are error-prone, and an automated procedure for TE identification and classification would be no exception. It is therefore crucial to provide not only the TE reference sequences, but also evidence justifying their classification, at the scale of the whole genome. A few TE databases already exist, but none provides evidence to justify TE classification. Moreover, biological information about the sequences remains globally poor.,We present here the RepetDB database developed in the framework of GnpIS, a genetic and genomic information system. RepetDB is designed to store and retrieve detected, classified and annotated TEs in a standardized manner. RepetDB is an implementation with extensions of InterMine, an open-source data warehouse framework used here to store, search, browse, analyze and compare all the data recorded for each TE reference sequence. InterMine can display diverse information for each sequence and allows simple to very complex queries. Finally, TE data are displayed via a worldwide data discovery portal. RepetDB is accessible at urgi.versailles.inra.fr/repetdb.,RepetDB is designed to be a TE knowledge base populated with full de novo TE annotations of complete (or near-complete) genome sequences. Indeed, the description and classification of TEs facilitates the exploration of specific TE families, superfamilies or orders across a large range of species. It also makes possible cross-species searches and comparisons of TE family content between genomes.,Transposable elements (TEs) are major players in the structure and evolution of eukaryote genomes. Thanks to their ability to move around and replicate within genomes, they are probably the most important contributors to genome plasticity [1]. Indeed, genome size is generally correlated with TE abundance: with up to 90% of the genome consisting of TE sequences in some species, such as wheat [2] and wheat powdery mildew fungus [3] [4]. The difference of the genome size of Zea luxurians and Zea mays is directly correlated to the abundance of TE in these 2 genomes [5]. The insertion of TEs close to genes can affect gene structure, expression and function, contributing to the genetic diversity underlying species adaptation [6]. Many studies have shown that TEs are generally silenced through epigenetic defense mechanisms, and that these elements play an important role in epigenetic genome regulation [7].,TE detection and annotation is, thus, now considered essential for any genome study. With the development of new high-throughput sequencing technologies, a large number of genomes have been sequenced, resulting in very large amounts of sequence data. Automated TE de novo detection software can provide up to thousands of TE reference sequences per genome, generally in the form of consensuses. TEs are then classified into two classes, with various subclasses, orders and superfamilies defined on the basis of mechanistic, enzymatic and sequence similarity criteria. The two classes of TEs are defined on the basis of their transposition mechanisms: with (Class I) or without (Class II) an RNA intermediate [8]. TE identification often makes use of popular pipelines, such as RepeatModeler [9] and TEdenovo pipeline from the REPET package [10], including tools for the identification of repeats, their grouping into TE families, and the generation of multiple alignments to build TE consensus sequences. TE classification is usually based on similarity to known TEs and protein domains and/or according sequence structure [11].,Several databases for describing TE reference sequences already exist. Repbase Update [12, 13] contains (i) complete consensus sequences for TE families (70% of the database) built with homemade pipelines based principally on Recon [14] and LTR-FINDER [15], and (ii) TE copy sequences (complete or incomplete) extracted from individual genomic loci. DFAM [16], another database for repeats DNA families is based on profiles HMM constructed from multiple sequence alignment. The entries of Dfam are Repbase-derived library (humans, mouse, zebrafish, fly and nematodes). The Gypsy database (GyDB) [17] stores LTR-retroelements, including those of the Gypsy/Copia superfamilies in particular, and Retroviridae-like elements including sequences from the Caulimoviridae (plants Endoviruses). The SINE database (SINEBase) is dedicated to SINE elements prediction [18]. The P-MITE database hosts Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) from 41 plant genomes [19]. The TIGR Plant Repeat Database [20] is a set of resources for the identification of repeats, including TEs, rDNAs, and telomere-associated sequences, populated with repeat sequences from 12 plant genomes from GenBank. This initial dataset is extended on the basis of sequence similarities between these sequences and GenBank sequences. The Transposable Elements Platform (TREP) is a curated TE database (http://botserv2.uzh.ch/kelldata/trep-db/index.html) mostly for monocotyledons and fungi. The MIPS Repeats database (PGSB-REdat) and Catalog (PGSC-REcat) are parts of the Plant Genome and Systems Biology platform (PGSB) including PlantsDB [21]. They contain TEs retrieved from TREP, TIGR repeats, Repbase and detected de novo in the genome sequences stored in PlantsDB. All these databases are accessed through web browsers and/or quick or advanced search forms. The curation of TE reference sequences is generally poor and based on automatic procedures.,However, intrinsic automated TE classification is an error-prone process. There was, therefore, an urgent need for annotation with TE consensus sequences together with the evidence justifying TE classification. None of the existing TE databases can provide the evidence on which the proposed classification is based. We filled this gap by developing the RepetDB database in the framework of GnpIS, a genetic and genomic Information System [22]. RepetDB is an instance of InterMine, a public open-source data warehouse that has been specially customized and enhanced [23, 24] with JBrowse [25] for searching, browsing, analyzing and comparing all the data provided for each TE consensus sequence in the many genomes analyzed. We use the powerful capacities of InterMine to create user-friendly interfaces allowing researchers to search and query data in multiple manners. Data can be exported in many commonly used formats, including fasta, GFF, BED or other tab-delimited formats. In addition, InterMine provides APIs in various languages, including Perl, Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, for accessing its features via web services. The full capabilities of these web services are described at http://iodocs.apps.intermine.org/."

In particular, reconstructing the phylogenetic position of the gray whales (Eschrichtiidae) has been complicated by evolutionary processes such as gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, whole-genome sequencing data of the extant baleen whale radiation allowed us to identify transposable element (TE) insertions in order to perform phylogenomic analyses and measure germline insertion rates of TEs. Baleen whales exhibit the slowest nucleotide substitution rate among mammals, hence we additionally examined the evolutionary insertion rates of TE insertions across the genomes.,In eleven whole-genome sequences representing the extant radiation of baleen whales, we identified 91,859 CHR-SINE insertions that were used to reconstruct the phylogeny with different approaches as well as perform evolutionary network analyses and a quantification of conflicting phylogenetic signals. Our results indicate that the radiation of rorquals and gray whales might not be bifurcating. The morphologically derived gray whales are placed inside the rorqual group, as the sister-species to humpback and fin whales. Detailed investigation of TE insertion rates confirm that a mutational slow down in the whale lineage is present but less pronounced for TEs than for nucleotide substitutions.,Whole genome sequencing based detection of TE insertions showed that the speciation processes in baleen whales represent a rapid radiation. Large genome-scale TE data sets in addition allow to understand retrotransposition rates in non-model organisms and show the potential for TE calling methods to study the evolutionary history of species.,The bifurcating tree of life, where at each speciation event one ancestral lineage split into two new species, is a concept deeply rooted in the field of evolutionary biology. The opposite, that several new lineages diverge from the same speciation event, a so called polytomy, is mostly regarded as an artefact of limited phylogenetic information [1]. The sequencing and analyses of complete genomes was expected to finally resolve ambiguous relationships by providing enormous amounts of data [2]. Instead of resolving long standing phylogenetic controversies, genome-scale datasets revealed a lot of natural complexity in the phylogenetic data that previously had been deemed as noise [3, 4].,The evolutionary history of baleen whales (Mysticeti) is a prominent example of a phylogeny that lacked a scientific consensus for a long time [5,6,7,8]. In particular, the relationships among rorquals (Balaenopteridae) and gray whales (Eschrichtiidae) were contentious. While some studies showed that the only extant species of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) is phylogenetically placed within rorquals [6,7,8], others placed the gray whale as a sister group to rorquals, which was expected given its different morphology and feeding behaviour [5, 9]. Recently, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of nearly all extant baleen whale species suggested that the rapid radiation of rorquals might represent a hard polytomy [10]. To further explore if the baleen whale phylogeny contains a polytomy, we use transposable element (TE) insertions. TEs are a robust and independent type of phylogenetic markers, that overcomes many limitations of sequence based phylogenetics, i.e. based on single nucleotide variants (SNV) [11]. Furthermore, TEs evolve neutrally and occur interspersed throughout the genome. Hence, they avoid potentially biased phylogenetic signals from gene tree error or linkage disequilibrium that can occur in sequence-based multi-locus analyses [12]. In addition, TE insertions are virtually homoplasy-free because parallel insertions in the large genomic space are very rare [11]. Also, they are less prone to reversals or mutational saturation that can affect SNV-based phylogenetic inference [11].,In baleen whale genomes, the most abundant TEs are short and long interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs and LINEs), covering 24.5% of the bowhead whale genome [10, 13]. The most abundant SINE family in baleen whales are CHR2 elements, which are named after their presence in Cetacea, Hippopotamidae and Ruminants [14] and emerged at least 56 million years ago (Mya). Like most other SINEs, the non-autonomous CHR2 elements are derived from a tRNA sequence. They are mobilized by the enzymatic machinery of LINE1 elements via an RNA intermediate that is reverse transcribed to cDNA and reintegrated into the genome. Compared to LINEs, their relatively high insertion frequencies make SINEs ideally suited for phylogenetic inference in mammalian genomes [11]. TEs have a long history of being used as phylogenetic markers for different cetacean groups [15,16,17].,Due to advances in genome sequencing and software development thousands of TE insertions can be inferred from multiple genomes across species and individuals [18, 19]. Thus, genome-scale TE detection was successfully applied to analyze retrotransposition in several vertebrate clades outside humans [20,21,22,23]. Furthermore, WGS based approaches proved extremely valuable in phylogenetic inference because they can increase the number of discovered TE insertions a thousand-fold, providing enhanced statistical power and the possibility to detect processes of reticulate evolution [23]. By contrast, PCR-based approaches have relied on tedious and time-consuming experimental work to find a few dozens of phylogenetically informative TE insertions from hundreds to thousands of candidate loci [24, 25]. Selection of candidate loci using an experimental approach was often based on a single genome sequence, introducing an ascertainment bias in the phylogenetic signal [17, 26, 27] that can be avoided by the use of large scale WGS sequencing and bioinformatic pipelines.,Here, we identified 91,859 CHR2 insertions in the available baleen whale genomes. This dataset was used to reconstruct the rorqual species tree and allowed us to quantify evolutionary conflict originating from their rapid radiation that took place approximately 8 Mya, coinciding with the onset of modern global oceanic circulation."

One of the most conclusive cases of HGT in metazoans was previously described for the cellulose synthase gene in ascidians.,In this study we identified a new protein, rusticalin, from the ascidian Styela rustica and presented evidence for its likely origin by HGT. Discernible homologues of rusticalin were found in placozoans, coral, and basal Chordates. Rusticalin was predicted to consist of two distinct regions, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain comprises two cysteine-rich repeats and shows remote similarity to the tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor. The C-terminal domain shares significant sequence similarity with bacterial MD peptidases and bacteriophage A500 L-alanyl-D-glutamate peptidase. A possible transfer of the C-terminal domain by bacteriophage was confirmed by an analysis of noncoding sequences of C. intestinalis rusticalin-like gene, which was found to contain a sequence similar to the bacteriophage A500 recombination site. Moreover, a sequence similar to the bacteriophage recombination site was found to be adjacent to the cellulose synthase catalytic subunit gene in the genome of Streptomices sp., the donor of ascidian cellulose synthase.,The C-terminal domain of rusticalin and rusticalin-like proteins is likely to be horizontally transferred by the bacteriophage A500. A common mechanism involving bacteriophage mediated gene transfer can be proposed for at least two HGT events in ascidians.,Ascidians are marine benthic animals from the subphylum Tunicata (Urochordata), which is considered the closest living sister group to vertebrates based on genome analysis [1]. The name Tunicata derives from the unique exoskeleton of these animals, the tunic, comprising both proteins and carbohydrates [2]. A remarkable feature of tunicates is biosynthesis and incorporation of cellulose into their tunic. The ascidian life cycle includes a mobile larva possessing a notochord and a sessile filter-feeding adult stage [3]. Ascidians harbor diverse microbiota [4], and their cellulose synthase is thought to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from the bacterial Streptomyces sp. genome [5, 6]. The adaptive importance of HGT is supported by studies showing that mutants of cellulose synthase exhibit defects in metamorphosis and maintaining a sessile lifestyle, suggesting that it was an acquisition of cellulose synthesizing ability that permitted ascidians to evolve their sessile lifestyle [7].,Most of the described cases of HGT between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are thought to have involved transfer of genes from former to the latter [8, 9]. Possessors of former prokaryotic genes include multicellular animals [10] and, in particular, chordates [11, 12]. The fraction of horizontally acquired genes in a eukaryotic genome can reach 8%, as was described for the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga [13]. It has been shown that some of these horizontally transferred genes are expressed and produce functional protein products [14, 15]. Possible mechanisms of HGT between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are widely discussed, with viruses being considered as the most probable vectors of transmission into the genome [16, 17]. The existence of nuclear localization signals in bacteriophage proteins covalently bound to viral DNA lends support to this hypothesis. Facilitation of gene delivery into the eukaryotic nucleus by these signal sequences has been confirmed experimentally [18]. A broad range of gene engineering techniques adopting virus vectors for eukaryotic cells transformation in vitro and in vivo [19, 20] may provide further evidence in support of this hypothesis.,Compelling evidence supports the HGT of the cellulose synthase gene of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis [5]. This gene is expressed in the tunic-producing epidermis [7, 21]. Apart from epidermal cell layer tunic formation involves also blood cells [22, 23]. Several morphotypes of blood cells have been described for ascidians [22, 24,25,26,27], including hyalinocytes. In the blood of a solitary ascidian Styela rustica hyalinocytes and morula cells are two dominating cell groups, with an average abundance of 38 and 56%, respectively [22]. Hyalinocytes are characterized by the presence of numerous small granules. Their density is low, and so they can be separated by density gradient centrifugation [23, 28].,In this work we describe a novel protein, rusticalin, isolated from hyalinocytes of S. rustica and discuss its possible origin by HGT."
